# Bachelor of Science in Computer Science

Computing with Real-World Impact

* * *

Computer science is the base for countless industries and disciplines. Today’s employers need graduates with both a solid foundation in the principles of computer science and specialized computing skills and backgrounds — individuals with a generalist’s knowledge, but an expert’s eye for innovation and problem-solving.

It only makes sense that computer science education reflects this reality. The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) program at the Georgia Tech College of Computing prepares students to leave school with the tools needed to become innovators and global leaders in computing.
