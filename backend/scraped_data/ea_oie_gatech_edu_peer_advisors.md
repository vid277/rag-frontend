**Program(s):** GRIP - Mexico City _Summer 2023_ \| Chile - PUC Santiago Exchange Program _Spring 2024_

**Email:** [annielaster@gatech.edu](mailto:annielaster@gatech.edu)

_I love traveling, and I knew in college I wanted to live somewhere else and be fully immersed in another culture. So when I got to Tech, I decided that an exchange and internship abroad was a great way for immersion. So, I studied abroad with a GRIP international internship in Mexico City, Mexico and exchanged to Santiago Chile. I used the internship to eat as much food as possible and visit almost every museum in Mexico City(I went to 62!). In Santiago, I played tennis on my university's tennis team and studied winemaking!_

_I knew I wanted to study abroad long before coming to GT, but I could have never imagined all the things I'd experience, the wonderful people I'd meet, or the delicious food I'd taste while living in Barcelona, Spain. Study Abroad is truly such an amazing experience, and it is something that I recommend everyone to do once while studying at GT. I loved talking with the locals, commuting with the locals, adapting to the lifestyle of the locals, and truly feeling like a local towards the end of the summer. Reach out if you're interested in my summer in Barcelona or have any questions about the program!_
