# Academic Reports

We are proud to report that our community consistently accomplishes a GPA higher than their unaffiliated undergraduate peers. Fraternity and sorority members at Georgia Tech realize that excelling in academics is the top priority of all students. Scholastic achievement is a central part of each chapter's goals and each organization implements various programs designed to assist members in their academic pursuits. Programs include tutoring, study plans, study hours, educational programs, and awards. Fraternities and sororities provides a network of other students in your classes and in your major who can offer advice on courses, instructors, and form study groups.
