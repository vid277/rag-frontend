If "Lot Full" sign is posted at this lot, you have the option of finding a metered space in the immediate vicinity (there are 5 metered spots on Ferst Drive across from the Campus Recreation Center – 2 hour limit, 15 minutes = .25, 6 minutes = .10, 3 minutes = .05 ‐‐ bring change) or proceeding to the further State Street deck.

### After Parking

From the parking area, it may be difficult to see the ISyE Main Entrance Building given the state of construction. We suggest referring to the above highlighted map download to familiarize yourself on how to get to the ISyE Main Building entrance after parking (either by walking on Ferst Drive OR exiting your vehicle towards the interior of campus behind the student center deck and to the right of the construction area). The main ISyE entrance is located across Ferst Drive from the Campus Recreation Center (CRC). The ISyE receptionist's desk is located on the right, inside the main entrance.
