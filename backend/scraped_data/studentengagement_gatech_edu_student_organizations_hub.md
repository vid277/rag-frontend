The new John Lewis Student Center has 8,000 square feet of dedicated space for registered student organizations! This open and airy co-working space is available 24/7 for student organization use.

##### Reserve a Table

We have tables to support your organizations meetings and collaborations. You may book a table for an executive board meeting, team lunch, event planning session, or any other organization need.

##### RSO Storage

With 28 storage lockers dedicated for student organizations, the student organizations hub provides a central location for accessing your organization's materials at any time. Check out our [storage webpage](https://studentengagement.gatech.edu/student-organizations-resource-guide/storage) for more information.

##### Printing & Pick-Up

Printing and Copying Services (PCS) is Georgia Tech's in-house solution for all your printing needs. From small to large jobs, specialty prints to everyday agendas, PCS can help! To get started, email [pcs@oit.gatech.edu](mailto:pcs@oit.gatech.edu). RSOs can use their on campus Worktags (connected to your finance accounts) for PCS orders.

For smaller, immediate jobs, PCS offers a print release station in the Student Organizations Hub's Resource Room. For these stations, organizations cannot pay by Worktag.

##### Campus Mail

Did you know your organization can reserve an on-campus mailbox? These mailboxes are hosted in the GT Post Office and are $20 per academic year (fall to summer.)

To rent a mailbox visit the [GT Post Office](https://studentcenter.gatech.edu/georgia-tech-post-office) webpage.

Note: All RSO mail delivered to the Center for Student Engagement will be returned to sender. RSOs must rent a mailbox to receive campus mail.
