# President Cabrera Joins Tech Swimmers in Tahoe Relay

Jul 16, 2024


Georgia Tech President Ángel Cabrera’s team finished sixth in the Just for Fun category of the 2024 in the [Trans Tahoe Relay](https://transtahoerelay.com/) in the Sierra Nevada Mountains over the weekend.

Since its creation in 1976, the annual open-water race has become one of the premier aquatic events in the country. At the invitation of Georgia Tech alumnus Dick Bergmark, Cabrera was among the team of six swimmers completing the 11.4-mile relay race.

Other team members included swimming and diving head coach and two-time Olympic gold medalist [Courtney Shealy Hart](https://ramblinwreck.com/coach/courtney-shealy-hart/) and former Yellow Jacket swimmers Mike Wise, Jing Li, and Rodrigo Correia. Each swam for 30 minutes before switching off every 10 minutes for the remainder of the race. The “GT Fun Team” crossed the finish line with a time of 4:23:57.

Cabrera and his teammates weren’t the only Yellow Jackets in the competition. Three other teams with Georgia Tech affiliations finished in the top 10.

A solo 15.5-kilometer race is held concurrently to the famed relay race, and with a 4:11:23 final time, former Yellow Jacket swimmer and Olympian Vesna Shelnutt (pictured below) took first place.

The race began as a two-team competition between Olympic Club members. The event now welcomes 250 teams to Lake Tahoe and promotes teamwork and conservation.
