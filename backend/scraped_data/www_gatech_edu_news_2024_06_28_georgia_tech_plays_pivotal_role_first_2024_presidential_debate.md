# Georgia Tech Plays Pivotal Role in First 2024 Presidential Debate

Jun 28, 2024


President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump squared off Thursday, June 27 in the first 2024 pre-election debate, with Georgia Tech playing a key role hosting media and campaign surrogates.

The Instituteâ€™s McCamish Pavilion was transformed into the media spin room, drawing over 800 journalists from 173 news organizations representing 35 countries. Located just across the street from CNN's Atlanta studios where the debate took place, McCamish Pavilion provided an ideal location for journalists to gather and share their coverage through live reports, interviews, and analysis.

Members of both campaign teams were present at the Georgia Tech 8,600-person capacity indoor venue, along with several U.S. senators and Gov. Brian Kemp. The collaboration between Georgia Tech and the media highlighted the university's ability to support large-scale events, showcasing its robust infrastructure and technological expertise.
