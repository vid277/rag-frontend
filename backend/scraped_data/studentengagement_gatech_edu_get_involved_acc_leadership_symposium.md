The ACC Leadership Symposium is a three-day leadership conference aimed at engaging students with peers across the Atlantic Coast Conference.

Bringing together delegations from each of the 18 Atlantic Coast Conference member institutions, the ACC Student Leadership Symposium is designed to engage students on issues prevalent in the 21st century and to envision innovative opportunities to promote inclusion, human dignity, and the common good within their campuses, local and global communities.

Student leaders from current ACC colleges and universities have the opportunity to engage in educational sessions, hear keynote addresses, explore topical content, and participate in experiential application through their group project collaboration and presentations.

The 2024 ACC Leadership Symposium took place in February 2024 at the University of Virginia. The 2025 ACC Leadership Symposium will occur February 7-9, 2025 at Florida State University. The theme and dates for next year's Symposium is Accelerating Community Change.
