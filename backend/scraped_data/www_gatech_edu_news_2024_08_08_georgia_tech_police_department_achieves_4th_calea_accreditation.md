# Georgia Tech Police Department Achieves 4th CALEA Accreditation

Aug 08, 2024


In July, the Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) received its fourth accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). This prestigious accreditation signifies GTPD's commitment to meeting the highest professional standards in public safety.

#### The Significance of CALEA Accreditation

CALEA accreditation allows public safety agencies to voluntarily meet a comprehensive set of professional standards, which include:

- Comprehensive and Uniform Written Directives: Clearly defining authority, performance, and responsibilities to ensure that all policies and procedures are consistently followed.
- Reports and Analyses: Enabling fact-based and informed management decisions.
- Preparedness for Critical Incidents: Being well-prepared to address natural or human-made critical incidents effectively.
- Community Relationship-Building and Maintenance: Fostering strong relationships with the community to enhance public trust and cooperation.
- Independent Review by Subject Matter Experts: Ensuring that practices and procedures are reviewed by external experts to maintain high standards.
- Continuous Pursuit of Excellence: Conducting annual reviews and other assessment measures to maintain and improve performance.

#### A Legacy of Excellence

In 2022, GTPDâ€™s Emergency Communications Center made history by receiving CALEA accreditation. It became the first university communications center/dispatch in the state of Georgia to achieve national accreditation. This milestone highlighted GTPD's leadership in public safety and its dedication to setting new standards of excellence.

#### Moving Forward

GTPD remains committed to continuous improvement and excellence in public safety. The fourth CALEA accreditation is a testament to the department's unwavering dedication to serving and protecting the Georgia Tech community.
