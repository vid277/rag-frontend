# Graduate Student Advisory Council

## Graduate Student Advisory Council

The H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) has an active Graduate Student Advisory Council (GSAC) that serves as a vital connection between the School and its master’s and doctoral students. This council is comprised of four committee members who each serve a two-year term. Members have excellent leadership skills and are known as the voice of our graduate students in ISyE.

Members of GSAC provide feedback on the overall graduate program to the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies, listen to students’ concerns and ideas related to graduate programs and services, and host various events throughout each school year.

Some of the events organized by GSAC include:

- Ph.D. breakfast social
- Georgia Tech football game tailgates
- Holiday parties
- Annual Ph.D. Visit Day

GSAC members are available to answer questions, hear your concerns, and offer insight/advice to all current graduate students. Feel free to contact us.
