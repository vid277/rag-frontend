## First-Year Application Fees

The non-refundable first-year application fee is $75 (international applicants: $85). Students who pay an application fee but do not submit an application will not have their fee refunded.

### Fee Waivers

If your financial circumstances make it difficult for you to pay the application fee, you should complete the fee waiver area of the profile section of the Common Application. The eligibility criteria used for fee waivers is listed there and includes:

- You have received or are eligible to receive an ACT or SAT testing fee waiver.
- You are enrolled in or eligible to participate in the federal free or reduced price lunch program (FRPL).
- Your annual family income falls within the Income eligibility guidelines set by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.
- You are enrolled in a federal, state, or local program that aids students from low-income families (e.g., TRIO programs such as Upward Bound).
- Your family receives public assistance.
- You live in a federally subsidized public housing, a foster home or are homeless.
- You are a ward of the state or an orphan.

**First-generation college students:** If you are a U.S. citizen or Permanent Resident and neither of your parents completed a four-year college degree or the equivalent in the U.S or abroad, you are eligible for a fee waiver, which you will request in the Georgia Tech questions portion of the application.

**FEMA Declared Disaster Areas:** We recognize that natural disasters can create significant disruptions for students, with long-lasting financial impacts. Students living in [FEMA Declared Disaster areas](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations) may request a fee waiver in the Georgia Tech questions portions of the Common Application.
