## Regent’s Engineering Transfer Pathway Program

The Regents’ Engineering Pathway (REP) Program was established in 1986 to expand the availability of engineering education opportunities for Georgians. Students complete 30 or more credit hours of engineering pathway courses at University System of Georgia (REP Partner) institutions and then transfer to the Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Southern University, Kennesaw State University, Mercer University, or the University of Georgia to complete a B.S. degree in Engineering (REP Engineering Institutions).

Visit the [USG REP site](https://www.usg.edu/committees/view/regents_engineering_pathways) for a listing of USG REP partner institutions and contacts. Students may apply to Georgia Tech after completion of REP partner and Georgia Tech requirements

### Regent’s Engineering Pathway (REP) Requirements at Georgia Tech

Completion of all REP requirements does not guarantee admission. Students are eligible for consideration for admission to Georgia Tech as part of our [holistic review process](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/application-review).

1. **Submit a Transfer Application**


    Submit a transfer application by the [application deadline](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/deadlines-fees) of your intended term. Choose the REP-Regent’s Engineering Pathway program admission type when you apply.

REP applicants should check with their USG partner institution to confirm all course requirements are complete (or in progress) prior to applying. Georgia Tech will send each USG partner institution a list of their applicants each term to certify participation and completion of their REP program.
