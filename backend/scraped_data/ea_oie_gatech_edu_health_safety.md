# Health and Safety

Study Abroad programs organized and managed by the Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) provide supplemental insurance to all participants. This supplemental insurance is provided by Zurich, and 24/7 travel assistance services are provided by On Call International. This Zurich/On Call program is administered by Gallagher. The Zurich coverage includes medical, medical evacuation, repatriation of remains, and security (political unrest/natural disaster) coverage. All students who participate in GT study abroad programs or International Academic Projects are required to have this study abroad insurance plan coverage. For more information, please [**Click Here**](http://www.gallagherstudent.com/tech) and go to the "My Benefits and Plan Information" section of the website to access the plan brochure. As this is supplemental insurance coverage, all students should retain their domestic coverage while they are abroad.

**PLEASE NOTE**:  GT study abroad programs do not provide other types of supplemental insurance coverage, such as theft insurance, trip cancellation insurance, etc. An optional CFAR/IFAR (Cancel For Any Reason/Interrupt For Any Reason) policy is available for students through Gallagher. [**Click Here**](http://www.travelinsured.com/agency?agency=53810&p=53810AJG) to learn more about this product and sign up for coverage.  _If you are interested in this policy, you must enroll within 21 days of receiving acceptance to your program._ The clearinghouse [**insuremytrip.com**](https://www.insuremytrip.com/) is an additional resource for cancellation policies and traveler insurance.

##### **Counseling Services**

In addition to supplemental travel health insurance, students will have access to teletherapy through [Uwill](https://app.uwill.com/). Students can create a profile on the Uwill dashboard to access the services. Students participating in institute-affiliated travel abroad will put their current location on their profiles and automatically be matched with an appropriate provider who can offer support while they are abroad.
