#### Important Dates:

- Formal rush dates: August 17th - August 22n
- Rush kickoff: August 16th

IFC leaders will be available throughout the entire process for coaching and general guidance. If a student receives a bid and wishes to continue to visit other chapters, it is OK to inform the chapter issuing the bid that he wants to visit other chapters before making a final decision. Once accepting a bid, the student will need to complete the [Georgia Tech New Member Form](https://gatech.campuslabs.com/engage/submitter/form/start/600085) within 24 hours. If a student accepts a bid but still has other invitations from other chapters, the student must notify the other chapters that he will not be attending.

To accept a bid, you usually just say "I'd like to accept my bid". It's that easy! There are no financial requirements for registration/recruitment and no obligation to accept an invitation to membership of a chapter. So, what are you waiting for?
