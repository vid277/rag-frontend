# M.S. Computational Science and Engineering

* * *

Georgia Tech’s interdisciplinary Master of Science degree in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) is devoted to the creation, study, and application of computer-based models of natural and engineered systems. M.S. CSE graduates are exceptionally prepared for careers in industry, government, and academia.

The program is offered with the option to take portions, or in some instances, all of the coursework off-campus via Georgia Tech Professional Education.

The curriculum has been structured to impart students with solid CSE foundational knowledge and skills. It includes technical specialization courses that enhance a student's domain expertise. Advanced elective courses will enable students to specialize in a domain and technical expertise focusing on their particular interests. The optional thesis portion of the program requires the completion of an interdisciplinary research project.

#### **Admissions Requirements**

###### **Keep in mind:**

- Most students entering the CSE graduate degree programs will have obtained a bachelor's degree in a technical field, e.g., computer science, mathematics, or a science or engineering discipline.
- Students should have taken undergraduate calculus courses. Some CSE courses will require additional coursework in topics such as linear algebra or differential equations.
- Working knowledge of probability and statistics will also be helpful in some core courses and specializations.
- Students should have taken at least one course, but preferably two, and have developed a proficiency in programming in a high-level language such as C, FORTRAN or Java.
- Students deficient in one or more of these areas may still gain admission but should expect to take some additional coursework.

##### **Home Units**

Each student accepted to the CSE program is admitted to a specific “home unit.” Some home units may have some additional requirements beyond those described here. The CSE student handbook includes information concerning such requirements. Financial assistance and lab space are typically determined by the rules and practices of the home unit.

The following may serve as a home unit:

- School of Computational Science and Engineering
- Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering
- School of Biological Sciences
- Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering (joint with Emory University)
- School of Chemistry and Biochemistry
- School of Civil and Environmental Engineering
- School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
- H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering
- School of Materials Science and Engineering
- School of Mathematics
- George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering
- School of Physics

##### **Program of Study**

The M.S. CSE program of study is designed to be flexible by allowing students to tailor the program to suit their individual career objectives.
