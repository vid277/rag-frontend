### Training Sessions

The Montgomery Machining Mall offers training on manual machine tools each semester.  The training consists of 2 classes over 2 weeks, each 2 hours long. The first class is on the belt sander, bandsaw, and manual lathe. The second class is on the knee mill. Both classes include general shop safety and safety on all the machines you’ll be using.

The MMM prioritizes training in the following order: undergraduate coursework (ex. Capstone), graduate research, undergrad research, and then those who are just looking to learn how to use one or more of the machines.

Please register at the link below and if you have any questions contact Nathan Mauldin.
