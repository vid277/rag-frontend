# BSIE / MS Program for IE, OR, HS

BSIE students can apply for the BS/MS degree in IE, OR, and Health Systems and receive the following benefits:

- Streamlined application process;
- Early conditional admissions decision for an ISyE MS program;
- Waiver of the GRE.

To apply, please submit the [BS/MS application](https://gradapp.gatech.edu/apply/ "(opens in a new window)") through the Office of Graduate Studies.

The approval of the BS/MS application is not a guaranteed admission to the MS degree program but instead an indication that a student will be admitted contingent upon formal approval by the Office of Graduate Studies during the regular application cycle for the year of matriculation.

Students approved for the program will meet with MS program advisors and members of the Academic Office to plan for the MS degree, taking advantage of the following options when appropriate:

- Double-counting of up to six credits between the BSIE and the MS, subject to MS program approval, a cumulative 3.5 GPA upon graduation with the BSIE, and completion of the MS within two years of the BS graduation.
- Counting of up to six additional credits toward the MS degree if the credits are taken while pursuing the BSIE and are in excess of the 128-credit BSIE requirement. (In other words, the courses must be "fallthrough" courses in DegreeWorks and cannot satisfy any BSIE requirement, including free electives.)

Please consult with the Faculty Advisor for your MS program or ISyE's Director of Student Services with specific questions about double-counting.
