# Master of Science in Health Systems

The focus of the Master of Science Health Systems degree program is to train students to develop, apply, and disseminate new knowledge with respect to the analysis, planning, implementation, demonstration, and evaluation of operational and managerial systems for the delivery of healthcare services to the public.

The Master of Science in Health Systems degree can be earned by completing one of two track options, the General Track or the Predictive Health Track.

- **Master of Science in Health Systems - General / Practicum Track**

[Apply Now](https://gradapp.gatech.edu/apply/ "(opens in a new window)")

The Predictive Health Track focuses on maintaining health rather than treating disease with an emphasis on strong interface between statistics and health. This involves using new tools to identify and measure risks and deviations from health, and to intervene before a disease or health failure occurs. The General Tack is more broadly focused on the applications of operations research and management science methods in health care.

Master of Science in Health Systems students have the option to take courses from Emory via cross-registration. Graduate Students should obtain prior approval from the faculty advisor to ensure the course will count toward their degree. The details of cross-registration can be found on the Georgia Tech Registrar's website. Please note that registration deadlines are typically earlier for cross-registration. There may be a shuttle bus for convenient transportation between Georgia Tech and Emory.

Admissions to the Master's degree programs offered by the Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering are conducted by the School and coordinated by the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies.  Please note that admissions offers will generally not include any form of financial assistance; School assistantship funds are dedicated to Ph.D. students.  Students with an interest in research should apply directly to our Ph.D. program.

Students seeking admission to a Master’s degree program must complete an application using Georgia Tech's online application system, accessible via the [Graduate Studies website](http://www.grad.gatech.edu/ "(opens in a new window)").  Students may apply for admission in Fall semester only, with exceptions approved by the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies.

Can I start my Master's degree program in Spring semester?

This is discouraged for new Master's students. In rare cases, some students may begin in Spring but our course sequence is designed for Fall semester entrants. Please contact the [Associate Chair for Graduate Studies](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/user/47/contact) if you are interested in beginning your program in Spring semester.

Do I qualify for admission?

We are not able to make admissions evaluations via email.  Once you complete a formal and complete application, it will be given the consideration it deserves.  The admissions process will examine the applicant’s prior academic performance, including our sense of the rigor of prior degrees and their institutions, GRE scores, personal statement and recommendation letters.

Do you accept the IELTS?

Yes, the IELTS exam is accepted. See here for score requirements: [https://www.grad.gatech.edu/english-proficiency](https://www.grad.gatech.edu/english-proficiency "(opens in a new window)")

Do you accept transfer credit?

Transfer credit is accepted only in rare cases, and must be approved by the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies, ISyE.  A maximum of six credit hours are transferrable.  A transfer credit request should be submitted to the Academic Office in a student's first semester.

Do you offer an online option?

MS in Industrial Engineering as well as MS in Operations Research are offered as Distance Learning (online) degree programs.

See here for more information on our online degrees: [https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees#tab-master-of-science-degrees](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees#tab-master-of-science-degrees "(opens in a new window)")

Does ISyE provide financial support for M.S. students?

Since the graduate program in the Stewart School is exceptionally large, we have adopted a policy regarding financial aid that is perhaps somewhat different than that pursued by other, smaller programs. Generally, ISyE does not offer funding support to Master's applicants, and it is rare that our faculty offer TA/RA support (especially in a student's first semester) to Master's students. Occasionally, a Master's student might be offered a paying position, but this is usually in a student's second or third semester, and students should never send mass emails to faculty soliciting financial support. Should opportunities arise for Master's students, the Academic Office will send a mass email to all students.

Does it make sense to enroll in the M.S. in Supply Chain Engineering program if my ultimate goal is to receive a Ph.D.?

It could be. The M.S. in Supply Chain Engineering is a practice-focused degree and could be good preparation for Ph.D. study in supply chain applications especially for students who do not have much real-world work experience. Quantitative methods for supply chain engineering are covered in depth. However, the primary purpose of the degree is to prepare graduates for industrial practice and not for research.

How do I check the status of my application?

Applicants should track their status through the CollegeNet online status check at: [http://www.gradadmiss.gatech.edu/status-checking](http://www.gradadmiss.gatech.edu/status-checking "(opens in a new window)")

I work full time in the Atlanta area. Are any of the courses offered at night or on weekends?

Most current courses are offered between 8 am and 6 pm on weekdays. While it is possible to earn an on-campus M.S. degree while working full time, it will require attending courses during the workday. Contact the [Associate Chair for Graduate Studies](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/user/47/contact) for more information.

Is the GRE and TOEFL (if applicable) required at the time of application?

No. You can apply without having available scores, however official test scores must be received prior to officially being granted admission to Georgia Tech.

Is work experience required?

While work experience is not a requirement for admission, it is viewed favorably by the admissions committee when reviewing an application.

May I apply for more than one program?

Technically, yes. However, an applicant can enroll in only one degree program.

My country’s primary language is English, do I still need to provide a TOEFL score?

Exceptions are given to applicants from countries where English is the SOLE OFFICIAL language of instruction.  An applicant is also exempt if they have studied for at least one academic year at a U.S. college or university.  Please visit [http://catalog.gatech.edu/admissions/grad/toefl/p](http://catalog.gatech.edu/admissions/grad/toefl/ "(opens in a new window)") for further information on TOEFL requirements for international students.

My GRE exam date is scheduled after the application deadline. Can I still apply?

Yes, you can still apply. However, we can only guarantee a review (and decision) of an application for those who submit a complete application by the deadline.

What are the differences between the M.S. Supply Chain Engineering program and the M.S. Industrial Engineering program? Can't I find a supply chain position with either degree?

The MSIE degree is earned solely through completing a set of coursework, and only offers a few courses that touch on supply chain applications of industrial engineering and operations research. It is a broader degree. The MSSCE provides depth of coverage in supply chain engineering, with a special limited enrollment set of courses. Many MSSCE courses feature class projects conducted for industry partners. Students also complete a Capstone Project experience with industry. If you want hands-on experience in your degree program, the MSSCE may be a better choice for you.

What are the financial document requirements for international students?
