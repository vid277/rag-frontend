# Advising

Each Master’s student is assigned an advisor prior to enrollment. Your advisor is the first point of contact for questions about course selection and your degree program of study. Your advisor will help you create a program of study that conforms to ISyE's requirements while satisfying your interests.  Any changes in this program should be made in consultation with your advisor and if needed, the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies. Your advisor is there to answer any questions and to help guide you through a successful completion of the program.
