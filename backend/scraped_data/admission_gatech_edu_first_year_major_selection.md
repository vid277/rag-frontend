## Major Selection

When you apply to Georgia Tech as a first-year applicant, you do not apply to a specific major or college. However, on your Common Application, you can select an intended (primary) major and additional major of interest (secondary). We ask you to do that because consideration of your major is an important part of our application review process, as we seek to ensure an academically diverse first-year class. In our review of your application, we look for evidence of your interest in and preparation for the major/college that you list on your application. Read more about how we shape Georgia Tech’s first-year class each year [here](https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/institutional-fit), and learn more about the majors we offer [here](https://www.gatech.edu/academics/bachelors-degree-programs).
