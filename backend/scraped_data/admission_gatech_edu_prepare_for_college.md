## Prepare for College

It’s never too early to start thinking about college, and we’re excited to help you prepare. Your college admission experience should go beyond exploring higher education options, finding a good fit, and getting in. It’s also an opportunity to learn more about yourself—to understand who you are, where you will thrive, what makes sense financially, and how to use your resources along the way.

We’ve created this page to help you ask good questions, learn about what college admission readers are looking for, and keep perspective throughout the process.

We have also linked to resources that can assist you in college preparation and telling your story as you apply to colleges.

Finding the college that is right for you is an exciting adventure. We hope these resources will be good tools to help you get there.
