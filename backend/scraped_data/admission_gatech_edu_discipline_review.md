## Undergraduate Admission

## Discipline Review

Georgia Tech is committed to providing as safe an environment for our students as possible. We consider student discipline situations on an individual basis, within the framework of the values we uphold as a university. While many situations that individuals are involved in may be resolved and accounted for, some behaviors are so egregious that the potential risk to the Georgia Tech community is too great. A previous disciplinary violation or conviction does not automatically result in the denial of an individual’s application for admission. However, failure to disclose this information can be grounds for the rescission of an offer of admission, even if this nondisclosure is discovered after a person has matriculated at the Institute.

**A person who applies to Georgia Tech as a first-year, transfer, non-degree, or dual enrollment student will be required to answer the following questions, as dictated by the [University System of Georgia](https://www.usg.edu/). If an applicant answers yes to any of these questions, the applicant will be prompted to provide further explanation.**

1. Have you ever been convicted of or pled guilty to a crime other than a minor traffic offense?
2. Are there any criminal charges currently pending against you?
3. Have you ever been disciplined, suspended, or expelled for conduct code violations from a high school or a postsecondary educational institution?
4. At the time you left your previous high school(s), college(s) or universities, were you the subject of any disciplinary or academic misconduct proceeding?
5. Do you currently have disciplinary or academic misconduct charges pending against you from a high school, college, or university?

## How to Report Discipline

Georgia Tech requires that applicants disclose any and all behaviors that resulted in disciplinary action and/or constituted being adjudicated guilty or convicted of a misdemeanor, felony, or other crime. These behaviors include, but are not limited to, academic dishonesty; technology violations; alcohol, illegal drug, and controlled substance violations; disorderly conduct; property damage or theft; physical altercations; harassment; sexual harassment; sexual assault; domestic violence; sexual exploitation; and stalking.

We encourage applicants to share as much information as possible about the behavior(s) that led to the disciplinary or criminal violation, including what happened, the discipline or punishment imposed, and the verdict in a criminal case. Providing information about what an applicant has learned from the incident(s) and how he/she has changed behavior as a result is helpful to the admission committee.

_If a discipline infraction happens at any point after a person submits their application, including after admission, the person should notify the Office of Undergraduate Admission immediately._

## Discipline Review Process

Affirmative responses to the questions above will be reviewed by admission staff members during our review of a student’s application. These incidents will be considered alongside all other pieces of an applicant’s file as part of the holistic review for admission.

Upon review of the discipline questions above, the admission committee may request further information from the applicant. We also reserve the right to verify the truthfulness and accuracy of the information provided.

The admission committee, at its sole discretion, may consult Georgia Tech’s Dean of Students office and/or the [Georgia Tech Police Department](http://www.police.gatech.edu/).
