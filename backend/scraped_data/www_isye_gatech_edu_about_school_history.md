# \# ISyE History

The H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE) at Georgia Tech was founded in 1945 as the School of Industrial Engineering. Today, the ISyE at Georgia Tech is one of the largest and most prestigious industrial engineering programs in the world, consistently ranked among the top programs by U.S. News & World Report.
