#### Dr. Peter Rhee, BS 1983

“I have an upper hand on the health care system and the issues globally than the other surgeons who did not have this degree. The systems approach that I learned at ISyE helps me tremendously as I work towards developing a more efficient patient-based system to deliver not only trauma care but health care to all the patients treated at this hospital.  It has also been of great benefit to me as I work at the national level to improve health care.”
