## Dual Enrollment Counselors

High school counselors serve as important liaisons for their students and for Georgia Tech. We want to make sure counselors have access to all of the information they need to help their students apply and enroll in dual enrollment.

### Contact Information

The first contact for counselors is our Director of Non-degree Program, Laura Simmons. Please reach out to her via email or telephone.

- Email: [laura.simmons@admission.gatech.edu](mailto:laura.simmons@admission.gatech.edu)

- Phone: 404.894.4154


### Counselors Portal (Slate.org)

Do you already have a [Slate.org](https://slate.org/) account? Counselors who have submitted documents through CommonApp in the last few years have probably been pre-approved in Slate.org. On your dashboard, click "Colleges" at the top and then select Georgia Institute of Technology. This account will allow you to track your student applications through our admission process. It will also allow you to upload transcripts for your students. In July, we will use Slate.org to provide your admission decisions.
