# Celebrating Juneteenth at Georgia Tech

Jun 13, 2024


The Georgia Tech campus will close on Wednesday, June 19, to commemorate Juneteenth.

Juneteenth, recognized as a federal holiday in 2021, celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. While the 1863 signing of the Emancipation Proclamation freed all enslaved people across the country, it wasn’t until Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, on June 19, 1865, that slavery was formally abolished in the final Confederate-controlled state after the Civil War.

Beginning the following year, the day was celebrated among freed slaves in Texas as “Jubilee Day.” As formerly enslaved people moved throughout the country, the annual tradition took hold, eventually becoming known as Juneteenth.
