## Contribution to Community

Students involved in their colleges, community and/or with their family exhibit a contribution to their community. Students’ interests and responsibilities are different, and there is no correct formula for this portion of the application.

Students often ask what makes a good record or they believe there are certain things they need to list on their record. In reality, we are most interested in learning what you are passionate about, and we value the different interests our students bring to Georgia Tech. Some traits we value in this portion include:

- Creativity

- Commitment

- Self-motivation

- Personal Responsibility

- Compassion for Others

- Initiative

- Leadership

- Entrepreneurism


### Our Advice for this Portion of the Application

* * *

- Typically, students are involved in a few activities in a meaningful way. We recommend you list and describe the significant or transformative impact you made. Be sure to include details on leadership, level of involvement and time commitment (I. e. hours/week or hours/month, when applicable).

- This information should be submitted as a 1-page document in resume format.

- Highlight research, internship, family
responsibilities, awards/recognitions, etc. as important contributions. We also recommend listing
activities connected with your major.

- List paid work experience within the designated section in the online application.

- The Contribution to Community form is optional, but highly recommended.
