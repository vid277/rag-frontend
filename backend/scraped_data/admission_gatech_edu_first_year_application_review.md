## Statement on AI

AI tools can be powerful and valuable in the application process when used thoughtfully. We believe there is a place for them in helping you generate ideas, but your ultimate submission should be your own. As with all other sources, you should not copy and paste content you did not create directly into your application. Instead, if you choose to utilize AI-based assistance while working on your writing submissions for Georgia Tech, we encourage you to take the same approach you would when collaborating with people. Use it to brainstorm, edit, and refine your ideas. AI can also be a useful tool as you consider how to construct your resume in the Activities portion of the Common Application. We think AI could be a helpful collaborator, particularly when you do not have access to other assistance to help you complete your application.

Review the [Contribution to Community](https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/contribution-to-community) and [Personal Essays](https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/personal-essays) sections above for more information about using AI when working on your application.
