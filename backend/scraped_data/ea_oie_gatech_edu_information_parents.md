**A Note About FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)**

FERPA is a federal law that affords all post-secondary students certain rights pertaining to their educational records.  Under this law, Institute employees are not allowed to disclose information (other than "Directory Information") without the student's written consent.

As your student prepares for an amazing educational experience abroad, we understand you may have certain questions about his/her program or standing.  However, other than information that is public and posted on our website, we are not permitted to discuss the details of his/her participation.  All pertinent study abroad information is sent directly to your student, so please feel free to ask them to share that information.  If you still have questions, please have your student send written consent to their study abroad advisor [(see contacts)](https://oie.gatech.edu/staff#ea) to discuss their study abroad record with you.

For more information on FERPA, please visit:  [http://www.registrar.gatech.edu/alumni/parentinfo.php](http://www.registrar.gatech.edu/alumni/parentinfo.php "http://www.registrar.gatech.edu/alumni/parentinfo.php")

**Benefits of Studying Abroad**

In an increasingly global world, it is important for students to acquire knowledge and experience in dealing with foreign cultures. Study abroad provides, not only a new perspective, but also allows students to develop new skills, independence, and the self-confidence needed to survive and succeed in the global marketplace.  International experience gives students a competitive edge when applying for jobs or graduate programs, and also builds foreign language skills and intercultural understanding.

**Communication**

While your student is abroad, they will be very involved in the program coursework and exploring new surroundings, so will probably not be able to maintain the same level of instant contact that you may be accustomed to normally.  Daily contact may not be possible due to cost, time differences, schedules, technological limitations, etc.  We encourage students to become fully integrated into their experience abroad - rather than being tied to their laptops and phones, we encourage them to explore and discover.  We do recommend students to talk to their families ahead of time and set up a realistic plan of communication to regularly touch base, so that you may know they are doing well and to hear about their adventures abroad.

To find out the best ways to communicate and keep in touch, students may ask their advisor/program director, host university staff, or past participants about the different options that work best in the country(ies) they are going.

**Travel Information**

When studying abroad, your student will need a valid passport. It is also recommended that a family member hold a valid passport as well in case of emergencies.

In some cases, students will also need to apply for a visa to enter the country/countries where they are going to study. For visa information and information on obtaining a passport, visit the U.S. Department of State "Students Abroad" portal: [http://studentsabroad.state.gov/](http://studentsabroad.state.gov/ "http://studentsabroad.state.gov/")

Although it is not a requirement, some students obtain a Student Identification Card for their time abroad. This card provides a picture identification besides their passport, and includes benefits such as discounts, insurance, and emergency help. These cards include:
