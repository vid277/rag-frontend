# Resources for Students with Disabilities

The Office of International Education (OIE) is committed to supporting students with disabilities who seek

to participate in an international opportunity. Many countries hold varying cultural viewpoints on disabilities.

As a result, accommodations vary depending on cultural norms and country laws. While there are options

for student with disabilities, some destinations are better options than others based on accommodation needs.

An OIE advisor with the support of the Office of Disability Services will assist you in identifying a program

that will be able to provide the accommodations you need.

It is extremely important to start your program search early. Talk to OIE and the Office of Disability Services

about your accommodation needs at least six months before your departure. Please note that depending on

your needs, it may take longer to ensure that accommodations are in place for a given program.

If you have not done so yet, we encourage you to register your disability with GTâ€™s [Office of Disability Services](https://disabilityservices.gatech.edu/) [.](https://disabilityservices.gatech.edu/)
