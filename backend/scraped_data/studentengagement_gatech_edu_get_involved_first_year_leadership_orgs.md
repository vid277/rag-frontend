A FLO (First-Year Leadership Organization) is an organization with Georgia Tech departmental connections that seeks to enhance the GT community though events, friendships, and service.

FLOs are excellent opportunities for new students to build community and become engaged in leadership opportunities in their first-year!

If you choose to join a FLO, you will not only have the opportunity to impact the entire campus community, but most importantly, the new freshmen class!
