# Master of Science in Bioengineering

The MS in Bioengineering is an interdisciplinary degree program that merges an engineering education with life science and environmental science in the study of complex living systems.

Ranked 2nd in the nation by U.S. News and World Report, this unique program provides opportunities for students interested in working with the eight participating schools and over 90 participating faculty members.

Students who wish to pursue a Master's degree in Bioengineering may do so through the College of Computing. The specific requirements differ from those of the computer science master's program, and while the degree is granted from the College, applications for this program are processed through Georgia Tech's Bioengineering Center in the Office of Interdisciplinary Programs.
