Title: A Novel 'In-Silico' Method For Modeling the RBE of Clinical Proton Beams When: Tuesday, April 15, 2025 at 6:00 PM Where: Boggs Building, Room Virtual, Room 347

Event Subject

This thesis explores the variability of RBE in proton therapy, highlighting its dependence not only on LET but also on various biological factors. Employing a novel approach, this study first conducts a Monte Carlo simulation of a clinical SOBP (with para
