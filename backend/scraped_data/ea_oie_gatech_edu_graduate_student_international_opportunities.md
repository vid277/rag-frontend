## Other International Opportunities

IF the GT international options do not meet your specific needs, you can also find your own program or you can also register international academic or research work with OIE.

## Non-GT Study Abroad

If the GT international options do not meet your specific needs, you may need to find your own program- which is considered a [Non-GT Program](http://www.oie.gatech.edu/non-gt). You must have the approval of your Graduate Program to transfer any credit back toward your degree.

## International Academic Projects

Participants in [International Academic Projects](https://oie.gatech.edu/IAP) are engaged in academic or research work that will be partially or wholly completed outside of the United States. This might mean going to a foreign university with your Faculty Advisor to conduct research, doing an independent study project, performing research in the lab of a faculty colleague abroad, etc. Talk to your Faculty Advisor about contacts and ideas.

## Financial Information & Resources

Georgia Tech Education Abroad programs vary in cost depending on a number of factors. Students are encouraged to speak with their [**Education Abroad Advisor**](https://outlook.office365.com/book/OIETest@gtvault.onmicrosoft.com/) and view the program’s cost information page in [**Atlas**](https://atlas.gatech.edu/) to see the full cost of attendance for a program.

There are a few scholarships available to graduate students. These opportunities are competitive and vary in their requirements (e.g.: some have service requirements). Some scholarships are based on financial need and some are based on academic merit. These can be found in the [scholarship database](http://ea.oie.gatech.edu/find-scholarships) filtered by level (graduate).

Students who are looking to apply for a national fellowship should look into [Prestigious Fellowships](https://www.success.gatech.edu/prestigious-fellowships/). These awards can provide funding assistance for undergraduate and graduate study in the U.S. and abroad.
