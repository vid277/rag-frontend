This interdisciplinary minor connects studies of all African regions and countries (North, West, Central, East, South)—their languages, their cultures, and their peoples, both concurrently in their national and international relationships as well as longitudinally over the course of history.

This minor is designed for undergraduates who will enter a wide range of careers that can lead directly or indirectly to interactions with the people, the social organizations and businesses, and governments of Africa, both abroad and in the U.S.
