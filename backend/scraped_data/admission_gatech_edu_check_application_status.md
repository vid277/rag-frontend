## Check Your Application Status

Please note that applications submitted on an application deadline or the days leading up to it may take longer to be downloaded into our system, thus delaying activation of your account.

**Undergraduate Admission uses email and your admission portal as the ONLY communications tools for admission related updates. Please check your email settings to be sure emails from admission@gatech.edu can be safely delivered to your account.**

## Step 1: Admission Portal

* * *

As an applicant, your admission portal is the primary portal where you can:

- Check your admission application status.

- Track receipt of admission documents.

- View your admission decision.


This account uses your email address as the username. SAMPLE USERNAME: gpburdell1@email.com

**How to Set Up Your Admission Portal:**

- **First-year applicants** will receive an email with instructions to activate their portal the next day following submission of their application.

- **All other applicants (transfer/non-degree/dual enrollment)** will set up their portal when starting an application for admission.

## Step 2: GT Account

* * *

Your GT account is used to access almost all other GT systems. This account uses a system generated account username and a password. SAMPLE USERNAME: gpburdell1

**How to Set Up Your GT Account:**

_Please allow up to **one week after the submission** of an application to activate the GT Account or to see an indication in your Admission Portal that you are ready to activate. Around major application deadlines (i.e. October 15, November 1, and January 5), it may take **up to two weeks**._

- Visit [Passport](https://passport-prod.gatech.edu/activation/applicant) to activate your GT Account (note: you only need your name and birth date to activate your account).

- You will be assigned a GT Account username and will then create your GT Account password. Please keep this information in a safe location.

- After activating your account, please allow one (1) business day before accessing other GT systems, such as Oscar and BuzzPort.


Should you have any trouble activating your GT Account, please contact our [Technology Support Center](https://techsupport.gatech.edu/home).
