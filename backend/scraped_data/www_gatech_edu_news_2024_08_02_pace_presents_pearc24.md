# PACE Presents at PEARC24

Aug 02, 2024


Members of the Partnership for an Advanced Computing Environment (PACE) team recently participated in the Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing (PEARC24) Conference in Providence, Rhode Island. PACE, a collaboration between Georgia Tech faculty and the Office of Information Technology (OIT), serves Tech faculty and researchers with a sustainable, leading-edge, high-performance computing (HPC) environment.

PACE was awarded three 'Best Paper' awards -- the most of any institution in participation at the conference -- including 'Best Student Paper' awards for two of its student employees.

PACE Presentations and Awards:

- Yongnuo Yang, Electrical and Computer Engineering student and PACE AI Makerspace teaching assistant, presented “Exploring Research Dataset-Sharing Strategies for Concurrent AI Workflows” (by Yongnuo Yang, Fang (Cherry) Liu, Michael D. Weiner, Aaron Jezghani, J. Eric Coulter, Ruben Lara, Ronald Rahaman, Kenneth J. Suda, Jeffrey Valdez, Dee Womack, and Dan (Ann) Zhou), which was awarded Best Student Short Paper – Systems and System Software. The paper described PACE’s exploration of the best approach to storing AI datasets for courses using the new PACE-hosted AI Makerspace.
-  Keller Smith, Computer Science student and PACE student assistant, presented “Research Collaboration Discovery through Neo4j Knowledge Graph”  (by Keller Smith, Fang Liu, Deepa Phanish, Heng-Ju Chen, Rickie Chen, and Didier Contis), which earned the award for Best Student Full Paper – Systems and System Software. The paper shared investigations into collaboration networks among Georgia Tech researchers.
- Michael Weiner collaborated with external colleagues on “Onboarding Research Computing and Data Professionals” (by Gladys Andino, Scott Delinger, Jacob Fosso Tande, Timothy Middelkoop, Claire Mizumoto, David Reddy, and Michael Weiner), which earned the award for Best Short Paper - Workforce Development, Training, Diversity, and Education.
- Eric Coulter and Aaron Jezghani collaborated with Ed Hanna to organize the “Energy Efficiency in Computing” panel with the Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation.
- Jezghani and College of Computing’s Will Powell presented “Early Experiences with GH200 Platform," based on work in collaboration with PACE’s Jeffrey Young.
- Jezghani served as a panelist discussing student workers in HPC systems.
- Weiner, chair of the Campus Champions Leadership Team, co-organized and presented a workshop for the Campus Champions organization.
