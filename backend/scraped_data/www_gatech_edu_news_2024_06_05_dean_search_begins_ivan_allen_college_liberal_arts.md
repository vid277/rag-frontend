Georgia Tech will begin the search for the next dean of the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. The [search committee](https://provost.gatech.edu/iac-dean-search-committee), chaired by Dean of Libraries **Leslie Sharp**, was chosen through a nomination process and includes a mix of faculty, staff, students, and alumni from within the college, as well as other units from across campus.
