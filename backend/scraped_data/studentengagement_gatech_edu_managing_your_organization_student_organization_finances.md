## Common Funding Sources For RSOs at Georgia Tech

The following sources are popular funding sources for RSOs at Georgia Tech. Each funding source has their own unique requirements, so look closely:

### SGA Bills/Budgets

SGA’s Joint Finance Committee is a financial allocation body, chaired by the Joint Vice President of Finance, that is responsible for determining allocations of the **Student Activity Fee**. RSOs can apply for funds from the Student Activity Fee — SGA offers both "Budgets" and "Bills" as a form of this funding. Note: RSOs are encouraged to seek funding through Budgets as it is finalized in the previous fiscal year. The Bills process is supplemental and RSOs are not guaranteed to receive funding from Bills.

**Timeline:** “Bills” are rolling funding requests that RSOs can access throughout the year and have different applications requirements compared to budgets. "Budgets" are annual allocations of funds that are requested a fiscal year in advance of when funds will be received. "Budgets" should be used for items and events that occur each year – especially if that funding is needed over the summer or before the Fall semester starts.

**Eligibility:** Must be an active Registered Student Organization (RSO) in good standing

**How to Apply:** Engage Finance Tool. Applications for SGA Bills/Budgets can be found on Engage, tutorials are [here](https://studentengagement.gatech.edu/managing-your-organization/student-organization-finances/finance-tutorials). Please note that you MUST attend a required training (September) in order to submit a "Budget".

## Do you have an on-campus bank account?

**RSOs have the option to open an on-campus bank account through the Student Organization Finance Office.** There are two kinds of accounts that you can open: Custodial and Foundation. These accounts each serve separate purposes. Here's how to open an on-campus account:

- Make sure that your organization's information is updated in Engage and that you are in good standing with the Office of Student Engagement.
- Submit your request via email to the proper SOFO staff member - including your organization's name (to be used as the account name), and include contact information (name, phone number, email address) of your President and Treasurer.
- For Foundation accounts, the organization will need to include an explanation of how the funds will be used. A donation (check or cash) of any size is also needed to establish the account with the contact information of the donor included (make sure the check is written to Georgia Tech Foundation with your organizations' name on the memo line).
- Normal processing time is 5-7 business days. You will be contacted via email once the requested account has been established.
