## Property Control

### Keys

**Faculty/Staff**\- checked out by filling out the proper paperwork. Professors are responsible for keys checked out to their students.

### Inventory

When a new piece of equipment is purchased, it is tagged and paperwork is documented for capital assets under the purchaser's name. An annual inventory is completed at end of fall/early spring semester in which you are responsible for the equipment under your ward. If you take or check out a piece of equipment, you need to fill out a Equipment Loan Agreement form.
