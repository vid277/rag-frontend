The combined BS/MS honors program provides the opportunity to earn bachelor's and master's degrees in aerospace engineering (AE) in as little as five years. Up to six credit-hours of AE Options courses can be used for both the B.S. and M.S. degrees. In order to double-count courses, the master's degree must be completed within two years of the date the bachelor's degree is earned.
