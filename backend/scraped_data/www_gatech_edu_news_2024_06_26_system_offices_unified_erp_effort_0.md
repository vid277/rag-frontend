# System Office’s Unified ERP Effort

Jun 26, 2024


The University System of Georgia(USG) is moving forward with plans to select and implement a unified enterprise resource planning (ERP) system with the support of Gov. Brian Kemp, legislative leaders, and the General Assembly. A unified ERP will enhance the user experience for students, faculty, and staff across all 26 institutions through the standardization and unification of key central administrative systems onto a single Software as a Service (SaaS) technology platform.

Unified ERP is a multiyear project that includes the phased implementation of a cloud-based ERP platform that will replace aging, legacy systems used to manage financial, human resources, and eventually student-related processes for all USG institutions. This unified system introduces features and functionality that facilitate standardization and optimization of business processes across the university system, enhance operational efficiency, promote data-driven decision-making, and ultimately enhance student outcomes.

"By integrating data, business processes, and administrative systems into a single, cloud-based ERP platform, we are assured of institutional-level impact. This significant organizational and business transformation is not only exciting but also a catalyst for administrative excellence,” said Shantay N. Bolton, executive vice president for Administration and Finance. “With improved access to data analytics, we will empower our community to make informed decisions that drive positive change throughout the Institute.”

Since last year, employees throughout the USG, including representatives from Georgia Tech, have been involved in identifying key requirements for the new ERP system, for which potential vendors will be evaluated. Currently, the USG has posted a Request for Information to help evaluate the best options and anticipates making an ERP vendor selection this fall.

Bolton noted that this is an opportunity to embrace an end-to-end system that will bring together data sources across the system and drive efficiency and innovation. It will play a critical role in supporting administrative excellence, collaborative partnerships, and innovative infrastructure across the campus to support the Institute’s growth well into the future.
