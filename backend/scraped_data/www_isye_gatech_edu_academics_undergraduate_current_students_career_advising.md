# Career Advising

We are fortunate to have one of our distinguished alumni come back to ISyE as a Professor of the Practice and take residence in ISyE to teach and offer career advisement to our students.

**Career development meetings may include:**

- Career opportunities within ISyE
- Skills, activities and courses necessary for workplace success
- Resume review
- Job offer discussions

**The discussion should not include:**

- Job search help
- Networking help
- Resume writing
