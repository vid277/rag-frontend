## English Composition Frequently Asked Questions

## Why are two English Composition courses required to transfer to Georgia Tech?

Georgia Tech has a two-course first-year composition requirement (ENGL 1101 and ENGL 1102). If you’re transferring to Georgia Tech, you are expected to have credit for both courses completed. Each course is three credit hours in the semester system, meaning you need a total of six credit hours to complete both courses.

## How do I know if my course counts towards English Composition 1101 or 1102?

The [transfer equivalency table](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location) lists all coursework (domestic and international) currently evaluated for transfer credit by Georgia Tech. Confirm the course(s) has not been previously evaluated as "No Georgia Tech Credit Awarded" on the Georgia Tech transfer equivalency table.

## What counts for English 1101 and English 1102 credit?

In general, credit is offered for courses that meet the following guidelines:

- For ENGL 1101 credit, we’re looking for a writing/composition course with 20+ pages in total of graded writing.

- For ENGL 1102 credit, we’re looking for a writing/composition course with 20+ pages of graded writing AND instruction in academic research and/or a major research project.


Note that the writing should be _graded_, meaning that it has been evaluated and responded to by the instructor. When we look for the number of pages produced, we’re looking at the number of pages for final assignments such as major essays, presentations, and similar projects. Discussion board posts, journal entries, and similar activities may not apply to the 20+ pages we’re looking for.

## For ENGL 1102 credit, what counts as “academic research”?

When selecting a course, we recommend focusing on two key aspects:

- **Instruction in Academic Research**


Look for courses that explicitly teach academic research skills. These courses should provide instruction on locating, evaluating, and integrating sources, as well as using proper citation practices. You can often find these details in the course syllabus under the learning objectives or course outcomes.

- **Assignments Requiring Academic Research**


The course should include at least one assignment that demonstrates your ability to conduct academic research. This is typically a paper, annotated bibliography, or presentation that involves using primary and secondary sources. For example:

  - An essay requiring 3–5 properly cited sources.

  - An annotated bibliography that evaluates various academic materials.

  - A research-based presentation with supporting evidence.

## What if my school only has a one-course writing/composition requirement?

A number of schools require only one writing or composition course. If you’re in this situation, you can consider the options listed below. In all cases, you would still need to have six total credits for ENGL 1101 and ENGL 1102 credit. Consider exploring:

**Writing-intensive or writing in the disciplines courses.** Generally, these courses feature writing-focused outcomes (check the syllabus for outcomes related to writing and research) and include a certain number of pages produced.

**Elective writing or composition courses.** Many schools offer elective writing or composition courses that would likely meet ENGL 1101 or 1102 requirements. These courses may be listed under English, rhetoric, writing, or composition. These courses will likely focus on teaching you to write, make arguments, and use research in your writing.

We recommend checking the [Transfer Equivalency Table](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/transfer-credit) when deciding which courses to take to complete the [Course Requirements by Major](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major).

## If my English Composition course is not listed on the table, what documents will be required to submit a credit evaluation?

We recommend saving copies of your syllabus, assignment sheets, and writing samples if your course is not listed on the transfer equivalency table or is marked as "Appropriate Department Must Evaluate".

An official transfer credit evaluation is only available once a student receives an offer of admission from Georgia Tech. Unfortunately, our faculty is unable to accommodate the large volume of transfer credit evaluation requests we receive prior to an offer of admission.

## Can I use credit by exam (AP, IB, A-Level) towards my English Composition requirements?

Yes. Please review our [Transfer Credit Information page](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/transfer-credit) for our credit by exam policy. Credit by exam awarded by another college or university can satisfy [course requirements by major](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major) if the course credit is listed on the official college transcript and transferable on the Georgia Tech transfer equivalency table.

## Can I take English Composition online and they still count towards the requirements?

Georgia Tech accepts credit for coursework completed online. If the course is not listed on the [transfer equivalency site](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/transfer-credit-equivalency-tables), the course will require a transfer credit evaluation is you receive an offer of admission.

An official transfer credit evaluation is only available once a student receives an offer of admission from Georgia Tech. Unfortunately, our faculty is unable to accommodate the large volume of transfer credit evaluation requests we receive prior to an offer of admission.

## What if I am unable to complete two English Composition courses?

If you are unable to complete the required courses due to extenuating circumstances, you may provide an explanation in the “Additional Information” section of your application. However, please note that our applicant pool is highly competitive, and the majority of admitted students will have completed all course requirements.

## How many quarter credits are needed to satisfy the English Composition requirement?

Quarter system credits are calculated differently than semester system. To meet the six-semester-hour requirement, students on the quarter system must complete at least nine quarter-system credits.

## Can I use English Proficiency test to complete the English Composition requirements?

Proof of English Proficiency is required of all transfer applicants. Students satisfy this requirement by providing an official transcript showing completion of two English Composition courses (totaling six semester credit hours).

English composition courses must be equivalent to English 1101 and English 1102 courses at Georgia Tech. English language proficiency exam scores (TOEFL, IELTS) and English taught abroad as a foreign language do not satisfy the English Proficiency requirement.
