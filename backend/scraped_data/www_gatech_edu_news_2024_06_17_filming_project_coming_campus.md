# Filming Project Coming to Campus

Jun 17, 2024


The Georgia Tech campus will once again serve as a backdrop for a film production. Due to filming activity, the [Noonan Courtyard](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=82#!m/189975?s/noonan?mc/33.778771917968186,-84.396523?z/17?lvl/0?share), near the Klaus Advanced Computing Building, will be closed June 18 – 21.

Only authorized vehicular traffic will be permitted on Plum Street on June 18 and June 21, but expect delays. Regular vehicular traffic will be permitted on June 19. No vehicular traffic will be permitted on Plum Street on June 20, the day of filming. Alternative routes should be considered during this period.

Pedestrian traffic around the Noonan Courtyard may be held periodically from June 18 through June 21. Pedestrians should consider alternative routes to buildings surrounding the courtyard and plan for additional time to move throughout the area.

Filming activity will also take place on the second floor of the [Blake R. Van Leer Electrical and Computer Engineering Building](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=82#!m/11032?s/?mc/33.77778394059658,-84.39718600000003?z/17?lvl/0?share). Building occupants should also plan for additional time to move through this area between June 18 and June 21.

Adjacent parking lots will be in use during these dates. Parking and Transportation Services will send out specific information to affected permit holders.
