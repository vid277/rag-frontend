# MANUAL LATHE

COLLETS ARE A GOOD OPTION FOR HOLDING SMALL DIAMETER PARTS.

A collet is an easy method for holding small diameter parts. Each collet is sized to fit a specific diameter, and must fit snugly. The collet is threaded into the end of the spindle, after the chuck is removed and the collet clamps down on the workpiece.

1. ```
   Press the E-stop.

   ```

2. ```
   Select a collet that is the correct size for the workpiece.

   ```

3. ```
   Ensure that the outside of the collet and the inside of the spindle  are clean. ̀Wipe with a clean shop towel.			̀		̀

   ```

4. Slide the collet into the spindle.
5. Slide the material into the collet. ̀Never close an empty collet.
6. Push the collet closer handle towards the tailstock (to the right).
7. Rotate the collet closer ring to pull the collet deeper into the spindle. ̀Stop when you feel a bit of

9. Flip the tab on the collet closer ring to keep the ring from rotating.

10. Move the collet closer lever to the left to secure the material. When closing, you should feel a "click" as the mechanism engages. you don't feel the click, tighten the ring and try again. If the mechanism is too tight, loosen the ring and try again.

11. Rotate the workpiece by hand to ensure the spindle is unlocked.


# Note: See staff for more instructions.

![](https://www.me.gatech.edu/tmp/b5e7ad20-0fdf-4286-873c-f8a56c7f3063/images/7945e9e7459cc0a9df8938f6f663ec001874d909fe4a0b1d2ba5c0f261563c8a.jpg)

There are several common ways to hold materials on the lathe. Usually, the 3 jaw chuck is installed on the lathe. It is a self centering chuck, meaning that all the jaws move together, and keep the workpiece centered. The 3 jaw chuck only works on round material, or materials with a number of sides divisible by 3.

$^+$ A 6 jaw chuck works the same way, with the same rules.

For holding square, rectangular or odd shapes, a 4 jaw chuck can sometimes be used.

$^+$ See Shop Staff for 4 jaw chuck use.

# Using the 3 or 6 jaw chuck

1. ```
   Press the E-stop to ensure safety.

   ```

2. ```
   Use the chuck key to open the jaws.

   ```


NEVER LEAVE THE CHUCK KEY IN THE CHUCK, EVEN FOR A MOMENT. THE ONLY SAFE LOCATION FOR THE KEY IS IN THE KEY HOLDER ON THE LATHE, OR IN YOUR HAND.

NEVER OPEN THE CHUCK JAWS SO THEY EXTEND MORE THAN HALFWAY BEYOND THE CHUCK BODY.

3. ```
   Place your part in the jaws.

   ```


̀The workpiece must be inserted into the jaws deep enough for a secure grip.

̀If more than $3\\times$ the workpiece diameter is sticking out of the chuck, you must use a center to hold the end. For example, if the material is $1"$ in diameter, and 4" is sticking out of the chuck, use a center.

̀To help center the workpiece in the chuck, wiggle it when tightening the jaws.

̀Ensure that there is enough material sticking out of the chuck to keep the tool from hitting the chuck.

4. ```
   Tighten the jaws with the key.

   ```


̀Remove the key.

5. ```
   Rotate the chuck by hand to ensure that the material is centered and that there is no interference between the chuck and any other part of the lathe.

   ```


# USING A LIVE CENTER

1. ```
   Insert a drill chuck and center drill in the tailstock.

   ```

2. ```
   Slide the tailstock 1" from the workpiece and lock it.

   ```

3. ```
   Turn on the lathe.

   ```

4. ```
   Set the correct RPM.

   ```

5. ```
   Extend the quill until you drill into the workpiece about $1/4^{\prime\prime}$ .

   ```

6. ```
   Turn off the lathe and replace the drill chuck with a live center.

   ```

7. ```
   Move the tailstock close to the workpiece and lock it.

   ```

8. ```
   Extend the quill until the center is snug in the workpiece.

   ```

9. ```
   Lock the quill.

   ```

# SPEEDS AND FEEDS CHART

Use the wall chart to determine the correct RPM, cutting speed and maximum depth of cut.

If desired, you can use the following information to determine a suggested RPM.

# CALCULATING THE LATHE RPM

Setting the lathe to use the correct speed (spindle RPM) for the operation is important. Determining the correct RPM takes a combination of research, observation and common sense.

Common materials have a calculated value, called surface feet per minute or SFM, for the maximum speed that a tool can move through the material, without excessive wear or damage.

The SFM is used to calculate the RPM of the spindle and workpiece. RPM is based on the material being cut, the material of the cutting tool and the diameter of the material being cut.

![](https://www.me.gatech.edu/tmp/b5e7ad20-0fdf-4286-873c-f8a56c7f3063/images/fe8914b7324d4f1b7b8caf51f39d17c2ef2106ccb2d97ab06600e8c06ca7faa4.jpg)

For plastics, check with the manufacturer or shop staff.

# RPM $=$ 4 X SFM / MATERIAL DIAMETER

To convert the SFM to RPM, use the following formula. Example: $2^{\\prime\\prime}$ diameter stainless steel

$4\\times50,/,2=200,/,2=100,,\\mathsf{R P M}$ Example: $1/2"$ diameter aluminum $4\\times300\\mathrm{ ~~/~~}0.5=1,200\\mathrm{ ~~/~~}0.5=2,400\\mathrm{~RPM}$

Note : Observation and common sense will also help determine the correct speed. For example, if the tool is chattering and making lots of noise, something is wrong. Stop, look at the cutting tool, recalculate the speeds, and ask Shop Staff for help if needed. If the formula calculates an extremely high RPM, perhaps your math isn't correct. If you have questions about the RPM, see Shop Staff for help.

When it is time to start cutting, turn the spindle speed to a low number and start the spindle. Slowly turn up the speed until the readout is close to the calculated RPM.

# PARTING AND DRILLING

When using the parting off tool, set the RPM to about 1/4 of the calculated value.

When drilling, calculate the RPM based on the drill bit diameter, rather than the workpiece size.

$^+$ Using a small drill bit will calculate a high RPM. If the workpiece is large, you may need to reduce the RPM for safety. See Shop Staff if you have any questions about RPM.

# There are 5 commonly used types of cutting operations.

1. ```
   Facing

   ```


̀Removing the end of the workpiece, to make it flat as well as perpendicular to the length. ̀After facing, but before moving the carriage along the Z axis is a good time to set the Z axis to ABS 0.

2. ```
   Turning

   ```


̀Removing material along the Z axis of the workpiece.

̀The remaining material can be cylindrical or tapered.

3. ```
   Profiling

   ```


̀Using a shaped cutting tool to create a feature, usually a radius or chamfer, on the part.

4. ```
   Parting

   ```


̀Cutting straight into the workpiece along the X axis, in order to cut it to length.

̀Reduce the RPM to $25%$ and use lots of cutting fluid when parting.

5. ```
   Drilling ̀Using a drill bit to drill into the end of the workpiece.

   ```


Other lathe operations are possible, but not covered in this class.

$^+$ Boring

̀Using a cutter to create a hole in the end of the workpiece. ̀Similar to drilling, but it's more accurate and the hole can be made any diameter, or even conical.

$^+$ Threading

̀Cutting threads on the inside of a hole, or the outside of a shaft.
