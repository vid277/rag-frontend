# Schools within the College of Engineering

(AE) One of the oldest and largest aerospace programs in the country. Students in this program learn the fundamentals of engineering sciences in addition to specialty areas, which include aerodynamics, aircraft and spacecraft structures, flight mechanics and control, avionics, propulsion, and the design of aerospace systems.

# Biomedical Engineering (BMED)

An interdisciplinary focus that integrates engineering and life sciences to support the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Biomedical engineers often serve as integrators in multidisciplinary teams of engineers, scientists, and healthcare professionals in the medical device and biotechnology industries and at government agencies.

# Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CHBE)

Developing frontier technologies in drug design and delivery, biotechnology, nanotechnology, alternate energy resources, and environmentally neutral manufacturing. In these fields and many others, chemical engineers provide the intellectual capital that powers today’s global enterprises.

Civil and Environmental Engineering (CE/ENVR)

Focuses on the intersection of natural and built environments. Civil engineering students are trained to tackle projects such as roads and bridges, new technologies and materials for construction, strategies that help us recover from disasters, and projects to make our systems more equitable.

Electrical and Computer Engineering (EE/CMPE)

Focuses on the core of most technologies. Harnessing the power of electricity to advance the modern world, electrical engineering involves the design of devices and systems, from nanoscale computer chips to multinational communications systems.

Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISYE)

The largest industrial engineering program in the country and has been ranked as the nation’s No. 1 program for undergraduate and graduate students by U.S. News & World Report for more than a quarter of a century.

# Material Science Engineering (MSE)

Students learn to create materials with atomic and molecular structures to meet next-generation societal challenges in medicine, sustainability, infrastructure, electronics, and much more. Lighter and stronger metals, tougher ceramics, degradable polymers, and more affordable composites — all are possible with the MSE skills graduates develop.

# Mechanical Engineering (ME)

The broadest of engineering disciplines, combining principles from mechanical systems, thermal systems, manufacturing, and design. Mechanical engineers are critical to the transportation industry, working on the development of hybrid and electric cars to autonomous cars and underwater vehicles.

# Nuclear and Radiological Engineering (NRE)

Curriculum covers the basic principles of nuclear engineering, nuclear reactor core design, reactor systems engineering, nuclear power economics, reactor operations, radiation sources and detection instruments, radiation transport, radiation protection, criticality safety, regulatory requirements, and radioactive materials management.
