## ISyE Unix Accounts

ISyE faculty, staff, long-term visitors, and GRADUATE students may apply for access to ISyE UNIX resources.

### An ISyE UNIX account provides the following

- A UNIX account home directory
- access to the appropriate UNIX resources

Please note that it usually takes 24-48 hours to process a request.

### The following does not require an ISyE UNIX account

- Buzzcard access for physical access to the ISyE buildings and computer labs. Newly registered ISyE students are automatically added to our Buzzcard system the week a semester starts. If your Buzzcard fails to work, please email [facilities@isye.gatech.edu](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/contact-us?contact=8249) noting your full name and GTID.
- Login access to the computers located in the computer labs. Computers located in these labs authenticate using your GT/OIT computer account credentials.

**Apply for an ISyE computer account:**

## High Performance Computing

ISyE maintains a high performance computational cluster configured specifically for it's users. Our cluster consists of both general departmental hardware as well as faculty-owned systems. We use the HTCondor resource management system from Wisconsin. As such, any idle cycles are available to the department at large. Faculty-owned systems have owner-priority preemption.

We maintain a full complement of software on the cluster. Programs and products include but are not limited to Matlab, Mathematica, CPLEX, Gurobi, AMPL, GAMS, Python, R, SAS, and Xpress.

Currently we have 77 systems in the cluster. Rough totals for resources are 2,340 cores of x86-64 processing with over 28.9TB of memory spread across the systems. Systems are connected via ten gigabit and gigabit ethernet.

For future HPC efforts, ISyE is developing a full OpenStack cluster to support various computing needs including but not limited to Windows-based compute, Hadoop, Apache Spark and others.

#### Software Licensing

Licensing for all departmental software is handled through ISyE Information Technology. Software to be installed on ISyE equipment in student labs or in student offices must be approved by ISyE IT. Please email [helpdesk@isye.gatech.edu](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/masters/current-students/computing#contact) for specific details.

Installation of ISyE Software on personal machines, or installation of your personal software on ISyE machines without prior approval, is illegal. ISyE laboratory machines are maintained and refreshed on a weekly basis. All non-ISyE software found installed on ISyE machines will be deleted.

If you need to download or install a licensed version of software, email [helpdesk@isye.gatech.edu](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/masters/current-students/computing#contact). Only administrators are allowed to install any type of software/update to any of the machines (this includes chat clients, music players, torrents, etc.)

Software will not be installed on your system without proof of a valid license.
