# Our Chapters & Councils

At Georgia Tech, we have over 50 social fraternities and sororities that are divided into four governing councils. Within each council, chapters have the opportunity to collaborate, support one another, and give back to the greater community.

The main difference between each of the councils is how they facilitate the joining process for the chapters they oversee. The first step for any prospective member is to learn more about each of the councils in order to inform which recruitment/intake process you may want to participate in.

Below, you will learn about our four governing councils and how to get involved.

The **Collegiate Panhellenic Council (CPC)** is the unifying body for 8 [National Panhellenic Conference](https://www.npcwomen.org/) sororities and 1 special interest sorority. The CPC sorority community at Georgia Tech enhances the academic, social, and personal potential of each of its members. CPC believes that women are powerful and prepares their women for success in the professional world. The community supports its members as they experience the opportunities and challenges that college and a dynamic career throw at them.

### Unrecognized Fraternities and Sororities

An "unrecognized" fraternity or sorority is one which may choose to exist "off-campus" due to suspension or dismissal from the Institute or the chapter's headquarter staff. These organizations are not permitted to use campus facilities, post flyers, or have any of the privileges recognized organizations have earned. The Institute discourages students from joining a fraternity or sorority that the Institute does not recognize. Unrecognized fraternities/sororities are not held to Institute or council standards that govern the behavior of other chapters and they operate without the oversight, training, and education provided by the staff of the Office of Fraternity & Sorority Life.
