## Woodruff School Graduate Degree Program

Welcome to the Graduate Program at the Woodruff School. The Woodruff School is the home of the School of Mechanical Engineering and the School of Nuclear & Radiological Engineering and Medical Physics. The master's degree in mechanical engineering was authorized at Georgia Tech in 1922 and the first degree was awarded in 1925. In 1958 the first master's degree in Nuclear Science was granted and by 1962 the School of Nuclear Engineering was established. Below is a listing of the current graduate degree programs at the Woodruff School.
