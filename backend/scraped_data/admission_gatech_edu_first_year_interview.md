## Interview for International Students

Georgia Tech is a lively and collaborative atmosphere, and it is imperative that students are able and eager to contribute to classroom discussions and engage in the Georgia Tech community outside of the classroom.

Applicants who are non-native English speakers have the option to participate in a third-party, unscripted interview. Interviewing in this format allows you the opportunity to personally discuss your academic and extracurricular background while also demonstrating your [English language ability](https://admission.gatech.edu/international/first-year).

Interview providers include [InitialView](https://initialview.com/) and [Vericant](https://www.vericant.com/for-students/). **Interviews must be completed and submitted prior to the [document deadline](https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/deadlines) for your application plan.**

**We do not conduct alumni, in-person, phone, or online interviews with applicants to Georgia Tech.**
