## First-Generation Pathway Program

As part of Georgia Tech’s commitment to expanding access, first-year applicants not offered first-year admission may receive a First-Generation Pathway program offer to apply as a transfer student if they meet the following eligibility:

- GT first-year applicant not offered first-year admission.

- Pre-Calculus Math Completion (High School or Dual Enrollment)

- Parents do not hold a baccalaureate degree.

- Georgia Residency


Students who apply to transfer and meet all the requirements of the First-Generation Pathway program below will receive an offer of transfer admission for the specific term and academic major.

**Computer Science Major Restriction**

All Georgia Tech majors except for Computer Science are eligible for students when applying to transfer as part of the First Generation Pathway program. Due to high CS demand, we use a selective, holistic review process that considers a variety of comparative factors as part of the admission selection process for all CS transfer applicants.
