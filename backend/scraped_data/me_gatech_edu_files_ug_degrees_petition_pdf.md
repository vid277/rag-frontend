# ME & NRE Undergraduate Graduation – Additional Information

# Current DegreeWorks Issues

If you have any questions about your DegreeWorks audit or have anything that must be fixed, then contact your advisor . Some current DegreeWorks issues are:

# oFree Electives (ME Students Only)

Because the free electives have level restrictions, DegreeWorks does not always correctly separate extra humanities and social science electives so that the 2000 level classes fill in for free electives. If this is a problem, this must be fixed by your advisor .

Free Electives will need approval from an advisor. There are only a handful of classes that are not allowed to be used for free electives, but DegreeWorks does not make that distinction.

Free Electives cannot duplicate any material already taken for the BSME degree.

# GPA Requirements: Overall GPA and Major (ME or NRE) GPA

Overall GPA : Your truncated overall GPA must be 2.00 or greater (no rounding up) to graduate.
