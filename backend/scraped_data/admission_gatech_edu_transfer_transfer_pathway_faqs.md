## Transfer Pathway Frequently Asked Questions

Below, we have shared some of the most frequently asked questions about transfer pathways. Whether you just received a pathway offer, are working on your pathway application to transfer to Georgia Tech, or have questions about the application review process, we hope you can find some helpful insights on this page.

If you have further questions, please [contact our office](https://admission.gatech.edu/contact).

## Receiving a Pathway Offer

## I have a Conditional Transfer Pathway offer. When will I receive my application decision?

Students with a summer 2025 Conditional Transfer Pathway offer will receive a decision on April 1 after review of their fall term grades and self-reported spring grades. Georgia Tech will add a grade report form in March for applicants to complete.

Georgia Tech reserves the right to delay decision notification until May if our office requires updated spring grades prior to a final application decision. Any offer of admission is specific to the application term and contingent upon completion of in-progress coursework and final transcript review to verify [Conditional Transfer Pathway requirements](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/conditional-pathway) have been met.

Students receiving a Conditional Transfer Pathway offer after December 1, 2024, will receive a fall decision release notification in mid-June.

## I applied to Georgia Tech as a first-year student. Do I need to complete another application for this offer?

Yes. You must complete and submit the online transfer application and pay the non-refundable application fee by the [application deadline](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/deadlines-fees) of the application term. Select an entering status of regular or international transfer student. Our office will match your application with the correct pathway offer after application submission.

## Will I receive an offer of admission if I apply to transfer with this pathway program?

Students who apply to transfer for a GT major except Computer Science and meet all the requirements of their transfer pathway program offer will receive an offer of admission for the specific term. Students applying for CS will receive a holistic review and all CS applicants for the term will be considered as part of the admission selection process. Students not meeting requirements may apply as part of our regular transfer application process available each term (fall, spring, and summer).

## How many credit hours must I complete after high school graduation for my pathway program?

Students must complete a minimum of 30 semester or 45 quarter credit hours after high school graduation and by the course requirement deadline. Students with dual enrollment credit are still required to complete 30 semester or 45 quarter credit hours after high school graduation as part of their pathway program.

## Which college do you recommend I attend to achieve the pathway requirements?

Please review the [GT Transfer Equivalency](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location) page to ensure that your transfer institution is listed and that your courses are eligible for transfer. If your institution is not listed, verify that it is accredited by one of the six regional accrediting bodies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. These accrediting bodies include:

- Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE)

- New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE)

- Higher Learning Commission (HLC)

- Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU)

- Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)

- WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC)


## Can my transfer pathway program offer be extended?

No. The pathway program offer is specific to the time period or transfer term listed on your first-year application decision letter. Each pathway program is optional. Students choosing to stay at their current institution or not able to meet pathway program requirements may apply through our regular transfer process.

## Course Requirements and Credit Hours

Please also review our [course requirements](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major) and [credit policies](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/transfer-credit). If you have further questions about English Composition, [review our additional FAQs](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/english-composition-faqs/).

## How can students prepare to complete course requirement by major?

Determine if you will need a pre-requisite before you are allowed to take Calculus I or lab science courses (ex. Calculus based Physics I). If you have a pre-requisite requirement, then you may need to take a class immediately after your high school graduation during the late short summer so you can complete course requirements by major by the [course requirement deadline](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/deadlines-fees) of your specified entry term.

[Review Course Requirements](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major)

## When must the course requirements by major be complete to meet pathway requirements?

**Students receiving a transfer pathway program offer before December 2024:**

- Spring applicants – course requirement deadline is December 15, 2024.

- Summer applicants – course requirement deadline is May 15, 2025.

- Fall applicants – course requirement deadline is May 30, 2025.


**Students receiving a transfer pathway program offer after December 1, 2024:**

- Spring applicants – course requirement deadline is the application deadline.

- Summer applicants – course requirement deadline is the application deadline.

- Fall applicants – course requirement deadline is May 30.


**Fall Applicants – Important Notes:**

Coursework completed after May 30 is not included within our application review with no exceptions. Students attending an institution on a quarter credit system will not meet the May 30 deadline if they require the spring quarter to complete course or credit requirements since it ends after May 30. The summer term **immediately after high school graduation** may be used to complete course requirements and credit hour requirements. The summer term prior to the expected fall entry term may not be used to complete pathway requirements.

## If I attend an institution on a quarter credit system, will I be able to meet the May 30 course requirement and credit hour deadlines?

Students attending an institution on a quarter credit system will not meet the May 30 deadline if they require the spring quarter to complete course or credit requirements since it ends after May 30. Academic calendars and credit systems vary by institution. Check to see if a college is on a quarter credit or semester credit system. When classes begin and end vary a great deal between quarter and semester credit systems. Be sure to confirm you can complete 30 semester or 45 quarter credit hours by May 30 to meet pathway program requirements.

## Why is coursework equivalent to English Composition 1101 and 1102 at Georgia Tech required for transfers?

Georgia Tech offers a limited number of English Composition courses, and the University System of Georgia (USG) requires both courses as part of any undergraduate degree. Students are required to have six semester credit hours in English Composition to satisfy a USG degree requirement. English Composition courses at Georgia Tech are reserved for first-year students so course availability is very limited.

## Can I attend a Maymester term and meet the course requirement deadline?

In our review process, Maymester coursework is considered part of the summer term unless you can provide an official transcript with final grades before the May 30 deadline.

## What are my options if my college does not offer coursework equivalent to English Composition 1101 and 1102 at Georgia Tech?

[eCore](https://ecore.usg.edu/) is available through the University System of Georgia and provides online courses in [English Composition 1101 and 1102](https://catalog.gatech.edu/coursesaz/engl/). Students can also explore our [transfer equivalency table](https://oscar.gatech.edu/) to identify college options that offer equivalent coursework to ENGL 1101 and 1102 online or at a nearby campus. English composition courses must be writing intensive and include written assignments totaling a minimum of 20 pages with 7 cited sources.

University System of Georgia (USG) policy requires students complete English Composition requirements prior to earning 30 semester credit hours. As a result, Georgia Tech requires transfers to have English Composition requirements complete prior to enrollment.

## Can credit by exam (AP/IB/SAT subject names) be used to satisfy course requirements?

Yes. Please review our [credit by exam policy](https://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate/credit-tests-scores/advanced-placement-exams/). Georgia Tech will honor credit by exam awards that are clearly articulated on the official transcript and are [transferable](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location) to Georgia Tech.

## Do credit by exam awards count as part of the minimum 30 credit hours?

No. Credit by exam awards are not included within the 30 credit hour requirement. The credit hour requirement must be completed after high school graduation.

## Where can I go to see if a course is transferable from another institution?

Please use Georgia Tech’s [transfer equivalency table](https://oscar.gatech.edu/) online to view transfer credit by institution. The transfer equivalency table is managed by the Office of the Registrar and updated on a regular basis. Coursework not listed on the table will require review by academic faculty for transfer credit results.

An official transfer credit evaluation is only available once a student receives an offer of admission from Georgia Tech. Unfortunately, our faculty is unable to accommodate the large volume of transfer credit evaluation requests we receive prior to an offer of admission.

## Can Georgia Tech provide academic advisement on courses at another institution?

No. Georgia Tech faculty and staff are not able to provide academic advisement on non-Georgia Tech coursework. Please choose the best available coursework to meet pathway requirements. An official transfer credit evaluation is available once a student receives an offer of admission from Georgia Tech. We are unable to review credit evaluation requests before or during the fall transfer application review.

## Grades and GPA

## What courses are included within the math and lab science grade point average (GPA) calculation?

Mathematics courses at the Calculus or higher level (Calculus I, Discrete Math, Calculus II, Calculus III, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations) and lab science courses (Biology, Chemistry, Calculus-Based Physics, and Enviornmental Science). A lab science course must include lecture and lab components. A lab science course must also be equivalent to at least 4 semester credit hours.

EAS courses may not transfer as a lab science course to GT so carefully select courses that have a direct lab science [course equivalent](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location) or specifically indicates lab science elective at GT. Use the [GT catalog](https://catalog.gatech.edu/) to review course descriptions and choose the best available course at your institution. [Visit our website](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/gpa-requirements) to learn more about how we evaluate GPA.

Students attending a quarter system institution will need multiple lab sciences courses to equal the four-semester credit hour requirement for a lab science course at GT. A quarter credit is approximately two-thirds of a semester credit since the 10 weeks in a quarter is one-third less than the semester requirement.

## What if I receive a D or F in my college coursework?

Grades below a C- minus will not be included in total credit hours or meet minimum course requirements by major.

## Can I meet transfer pathway requirements if I received a C grade in my Dual Enrollment coursework?

Students receiving a transfer pathway program offer after December 1, 2024, with a C grade or lower in Dual Enrollment coursework will be reviewed [holistically](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/application-review) and may not be admitted as a pathway applicant.

## Are dual enrollment grades included within GPA calculations?

Yes. Dual Enrollment grades are included within GPA calculations, and courses can count toward your course requirements by major. They do not count towards the 30 semester or 45 quarter credit minimum requirement.

## If I choose to take a course on a pass/fail basis, how will it be considered during the application review process?

Pathway applicants should have a letter grade on their transcript for all course requirements by major. If you choose to have one or more letter grades changed to Pass/No Pass on your transcript, then it would be appropriate to provide reasoning or extenuating circumstances for this decision in the "Additional Information" section of the transfer application. A Pass/Fail grade in our GPA review will be considered a "C" in our calculation.

## Application Review Process and Preparing Your Application

## Am I guaranteed admission if I apply for Computer Science and meet all pathway program requirements?

No. Due to high Computer Science demand, GT uses a selective, holistic review process that considers a variety of comparative factors as part of the admission selection process for all Computer Science transfer applicants. The holistic review process for Computer Science includes all Computer Science transfer applicants with or without a pathway offer.

## Can I change my major after applying or receiving transfer admission into Georgia Tech?

Transfer students are not allowed to change their major after submitting their transfer application. Transfer students are not allowed an unrestricted change of major once they enroll at GT. An offer of transfer admission is specific to the application term and academic major.
