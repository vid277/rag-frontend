# MILL BASICS: MOVEMENT

When using a mill, the material is clamped into a vise or directly to the table. The table is moved so that the workpiece moves past a spinning cutter.

The table can move in 3 directions, called X, $\\Upsilon,\\pounds,2$ .

$^+$ X is the long horizontal axis

![](https://www.me.gatech.edu/tmp/5a4bba85-7c69-4674-95a9-dfaa8c41491d/images/a1c5f4a8d597dc93027958a6f12556eac88fee02fbf0b49e0c8c4469b0946966.jpg)

$^+$ Handwheels and power feeds move the table horizontally $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{\\Sigma}\_{\\mathsf{\\Sigma}}^{\\star},\\mathsf{Y})$ .

$^+$ Z crank moves the table vertically (Z).

+Locks keep the table from moving. ̀Lock each axis that is not moving. ̀Unlock an axis before moving it.

![](https://www.me.gatech.edu/tmp/5a4bba85-7c69-4674-95a9-dfaa8c41491d/images/90777259c32a9154498a8db0294d3233756a972c514ee75cd2b1910dceb3c858.jpg)

# END MILLS AND COLLETS

End mills and drill bits are the most common cutting tools used in a mill.

$^+$ End mills are designed to cut while moving sideways through the material, in X or Y. $^+$ Drill bits can only cut while moving in Z.

End mills come in different diameters, lengths, and shapes.

Each cutter requires a different RPM depending on the material being worked - speed .

The flutes are the cutting edges. In general, use 2 flute end mills for plastic and aluminum, and 4flute end mills for steel.

Ask Shop Staff for assistance selecting an appropriate end mill for your project.

End mills must be held in a collet .

$^+$ Never hold an end mill in a drill chuck.

$^+$ The collet must be the same size as the shank of the end mill.

$^+$ Only grip the shank; not the flutes.

$^+$ Leave no more than $1/4^{\\prime\\prime}$ of shank out of the collet.

$^+$ Hold drill bits in a chuck that installs in the mill.

# INSTALLING A BIT AND COLLET

1. ```
   Slide the shank of the cutting tool into the large end of the collet.

   ```

2. ```
   Place the small end of the collet into the bottom of the spindle.

   ```

3. ```
   Push up on the collet, and slowly rotate it until the key in the spindle slides into the keyway in the collet. ̀Hold the collet in place for the next steps.

   ```

4. ```
   Push the quill handle to the top of the stroke.

   ```

5. ```
   Press and hold the gold bar on the power drawbar controller.

   ```

6. ```
   Press the IN button on the controller. ̀Hold the button until the pitch changes - about 3-4  seconds.

   ```

# USING THE VISE $\\boldsymbol{\\mathfrak{\\xi}}$ PARALLELS

Parallels are used to elevate your workpiece in the vice, and allow working on the top of your material, or to drill through it, without hitting the table or vise.

Only items with two parallel sides and a flat bottom may be held in the vise.

$^+$ For holding complex shapes, see Shop Staff.

$^+$ To install or remove the vise, see Shop Staff.

1\. Clean the vise $\\hat{\\xi}$ parallels with a chip brush or shop towel.

2\. Set two equal height parallels against the vise faces.

3\. Set your workpiece on top of the parallels.

4\. Have a minimum of $1/4^{\\prime\\prime}$ of material in the vise.

5\. Tighten the vise. ̀The parallels will probably loosen a bit.

6\. Strike the workpiece straight down with a deadblow hammer. ̀Never use a metal hammer. ̀Do not re-tighten the vise.

7\. See if the parallels will move in the vise.

̀If so, remove the parts, and start over.

![](https://www.me.gatech.edu/tmp/5a4bba85-7c69-4674-95a9-dfaa8c41491d/images/41b1dfdeb2cb7f48b12d2eb099d2bbf0d3ce6115acdae0ba8e3f63b3bed2ba3b.jpg)

# USING STRAP CLAMPS

Strap clamps are used to hold a part that can't fit in the vise.

Use a minimum of 2 strap clamps; more is better.

1\. Screw a threaded stud into a t-nut .

2\. Slide the t-nut into a slot on the table.

3\. Place the stepped end of a strap clamp onto the step block .

4\. Place the nose of the strap clamp onto the workpiece. ̀The nose must be slightly lower than the stepped end.

5\. Tighten the nut on the top of the strap clamp.

6\. Check that the part is secure.

# CONVENTIONAL CUTTING VS. CLIMB CUTTING

Conventional cutting is when the workpiece moves against the direction of the cutting bit.

$^+$ All manual mill work should be done with conventional cuts.

Climb cutting is when the workpiece moves in the same direction as the bit. $^+$ This is not advised on the manual mill.

$^+$ Climb cutting should be reserved for CNC milling.

![](https://www.me.gatech.edu/tmp/5a4bba85-7c69-4674-95a9-dfaa8c41491d/images/4bd21618f98119c1a57b6e0744a4ffc63508f55a83b0731213778e6c9d119337.jpg)

# CUTTING WIDTH AND DEPTH

An end mill can only remove a certain amount of material at once.

The maximum depth and width of cut is 1/2 of the end mill diameter.

$^+$ For example, a $1/2"$ end mill can cut no more than 1/4" deep and $1/4^{\\prime\\prime}$ wide in a single pass. $^+$ A slotting cut is an $\\ominus\\mathsf{X C}\\ominus$ ption to the width of cut rule.

![](https://www.me.gatech.edu/tmp/5a4bba85-7c69-4674-95a9-dfaa8c41491d/images/ce91594454e15115240de73f9fc608bb7362f9bf35c92174b4f7e07ad9308b59.jpg)

# USING THE POWER FEED

The power feed moves the table at a constant rate, which can help improve finish quality.

1. ```
   Turn the speed dial to 0.

   ```

2. ```
   Move the lever in the direction you want the table to move. ̀In the illustration, the table will be moving to the right.

   ```

3. ```
   Adjust the feed rate by turning the speed dial.

   ```

For accurate work, each axis needs to have a known zero point (origin). There are two ways to determine zero; create it or find it.

# CREATING A ZERO

# X or Y axis

1. ```
   Take a light cutting pass to make the edge flat and square.

   ```

2. ```
   Turn off the mill.

   ```

3. ```
   On the DRO (see next page) zero the axis. ̀In this example, zero the X axis.

   ```

4. ```
   Move the end mill 1/2 its diameter towards the center of the workpiece. ̀This will center the spindle over the edge of the material.

   ```

5. ```
   Zero the axis on the DRO again.

   ```


# Z axis

1. ```
   Take a light cutting pass across the top of the part.

   ```

2. ```
   Set the Z axis to zero. ̀The zero will need to be reset if the quill moves, or you change the end mill.

   ```


# FINDING A ZERO

# X or Y axis

1. ```
   Install an edge finder .

   ```

2. ```
   Push the bottom of the edge finder over 1/8".

   ```

3. ```
   Start the mill and adjust to 800 RPM.

   ```

4. ```
   Very slowly move the edge finder into the edge of the material until the bottom pops over to one side.

   ```

5. ```
   Zero the axis on the DRO.

   ```

6. ```
   Repeat step 4 to double check.

   ```

7. ```
   Move the edge finder 1/2 its diameter towards the center of the workpiece. ̀This will center the spindle over the edge of the material.

   ```

8. ```
   Zero the axis on the DRO again.

   ```


# Z axis

1. ```
   Install the end mill.

   ```

2. ```
   Lower the quill (or raise the table with the quill locked) until the end mill gently touches the table.

   ```

3. ```
   Lock the quill.

   ```

4. ```
   Set the Z axis to zero. ̀The zero will need to be reset if the quill moves, or you change the end mill.

   ```

# UNITS OF MEASUREMENT

Most of the cutting tools are measured in decimal inches by 0.001" (1/1000"). For example, $1/4^{\\prime\\prime}$ is 250 one-thousandths of an inch, and written as $0.250^{\\prime\\prime}$ .

The digital readout (DRO), as well as the digital calipers, display in decimal inches or millimeters.

# DIGITAL READ OUT (DRO)

The DRO displays the position of the $\\mathsf{X}$ and Y axis in increments of 0.0002" or 0.005mm The Soft Keys change using the left/right arrows. Look at the label above the key to see its current function.

HELP: displays help information, math help or additional functions. Active for additional functions when the help symbol (a blue question mark) is displayed on the screen next to the HELP key.

# Soft Keys:

Beneath the display are 8 keys that are labeled with arrows. These keys are called software programmable or soft keys. A description of the function or use of each of these keys will be shown at the bottom of the display directly above each key. If, at any time, there is no description above a key, that key will not operate.

Sometimes the description or function of the key is visible but grayed out. This indicates that the particular function is not available because of some other condition. For example, if there is no program in the current memory, the EDIT Mode softkey will be grayed out because there is no program to edit.

# Emergency Stop Switch

The emergency stop (E-stop) switch kills all power to the spindle and ProtoTRAK's servomotors.

The computer and pendant remain powered.

# The Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)

The display of the ProtoTRAK SMX CNC is a 10.4" active-matrix color LCD. The very top is the Status Line that shows the overall status of the ProtoTRAK SMX CNC. This includes the current Mode, the current program part number, the current tool number, 2 or 3-axis mode and whether the X, Y and Z dimensions are in inch or millimeter (mm).

Just above the soft keys is a data input line that appears when an input is required.
