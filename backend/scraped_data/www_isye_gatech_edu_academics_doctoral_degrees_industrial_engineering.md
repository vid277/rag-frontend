# Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering

The Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering degree provides rigorous coverage of core industrial engineering and operations research methodology, with application to challenges within critical systems such as supply chains, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and energy. The degree is offered in one general track and four different specializations:

- **Supply Chain Engineering**

This degree recognizes students with demonstrated proficiency and high achievement in research within the disciplines represented in the School faculty. Students earning the Ph.D. in IE focus on critical challenges in key systems, including supply chains, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and energy. After adequate preparation, the successful Ph.D. candidate must complete an authoritative investigation of a special area in their chosen field, culminating in a written dissertation describing the unique contributions created by that investigation.

New Ph.D. students are admitted for each Fall semester only, and the admissions process is coordinated by the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies. Decisions on applicants to our various Ph.D. programs are determined jointly by a committee of faculty members, potential faculty research advisors, and the Associate Chair. All applicants must select and apply to a specific degree program, although it is possible in some cases to switch programs after enrollment.

A prior Master's degree is not a requirement for admission into our Ph.D. programs, and students can earn an M.S. degree typically within the first two years of Ph.D. study. For those unsure about applying to a Master's program versus a Ph.D. program, please note that students in our Master's programs are not guaranteed admission into a Ph.D. program here; we do offer a simplified application scheme. If you are interested in research and a Ph.D. degree, you should apply to a Ph.D. program directly.

### Application Requirements

- **Transcripts**: Transcripts of prior academic work are required, as is evidence of an earned Bachelor's degree. Applicant transcripts should demonstrate strong academic preparation and capability, especially in advanced mathematics and computing coursework. Those with less preparation in mathematics and engineering are expected to use coursework at Georgia Tech to quickly establish proficiency.
- **Graduate Record Examination (GRE)**: Scores from the general test are required, and strong performance on the quantitative section is expected. Scores from the Mathematics Subject Test are not required, but can help a student demonstrate proficiency in advanced mathematics. **\*\*The GRE is optional for PhD applicants. The absence of scores will not affect the consideration of your application.\*\***  However, if you decide not to submit GRE scores, the rest of your academic record should make up for the lack of the test score.
- **Statement of Purpose**: The written statement of purpose should describe clearly why the applicant wishes to pursue the Ph.D., including research and career goals. While the statement should describe past experiences, it should also identify clearly the research area of interest to the applicant and the members of our faculty that might serve as research advisor(s).
- **Resume:** A resume outlining academic experience, research experience and accomplishments, industry experience, specific skills, and outside interests of the applicant is required.
- **Letters of Reference:** Three (3) credible letters of reference are required that attest to the preparation of the applicant and the likelihood for success in a Ph.D. program. At least two (2) letters should be from faculty members.

Each year, we receive many more applications from qualified students than we have the capacity to admit into our programs. To help admitted students learn more about our programs and meet potential research advisors, we hold an invitation-only Ph.D. Applicant Visit Day annually in early March.
