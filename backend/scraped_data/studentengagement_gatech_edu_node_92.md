# HAVE YOU FOUND A VOID THAT YOU BELIEVE A NEW STUDENT ORGANIZATION CAN ADDRESS?

### Student Engagement serves as a resource for chartering new Registered Student Organizations (RSOs). The Institute Registered Student Organization Policy guides the creation of New Registered Student Organizations at Tech.

Each Fall and Spring Semester, the Center for Student Engagement (CSE) hosts Charter Windows wherein new groups can begin the process to become a Registered Student Organizations. While groups are not able to submit paperwork outside of these chartering windows, we encourage student leaders to begin collecting the necessary materials in advance of the Charter Window. This allows the process to move more quickly and more smoothly for each group.

**The 2025 Spring Charter window is open from: January 27th, 2025 through March 31st, 2025.**
