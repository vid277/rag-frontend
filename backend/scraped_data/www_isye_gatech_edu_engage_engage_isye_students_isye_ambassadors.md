The mission of the ISyE Ambassadors is to build and maintain a hospitable environment where prospective students, current ISyE students, alumni, and members of ISyE can inspire, educate, and support one another. Specifically, the ISyE Ambassadors accomplish our mission in four unique ways:

- **Act as official hosts and hostesses to the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering** by promoting the ISyE program, educating current and potential Georgia Tech students, and providing tours to prospective students, families, and faculty members
- **Connect the ISyE community** of students, staff, alumni, parents, and faculty by understanding and communicating the needs of the ISyE student body to the department and vice versa
- **Extend the bandwidth of the ISyE Academic Advising office** by highlighting the ISyE department's resources and supporting registration
- **Develop a cohesive ISyE culture** by fostering pride in current students and increasing awareness of ISyE to prospective students

Through these acts of service, the ISyE Ambassadors support ISyE as a welcoming, impactful, and innovative world leader in graduating passionate global citizens within industrial and systems engineering.
