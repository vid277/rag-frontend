## Transfer Course Requirements

### Course Requirements by Major

Competitive applicants will have course requirements by major complete by the [course requirement deadline](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/deadlines-fees). All Georgia Tech majors require coursework equivalent to English Composition 1101, English Composition 1102, and Differential Calculus (Math 1551). Review the chart below for additional course requirements by major.

All course requirements by major must be transferable with a minimum C grade or better. GT’s [transfer equivalency table and GT catalog](https://oscar.gatech.edu/) are your two best sources of information on previously evaluated coursework. [Transfer pathway applicants](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/transfer-pathway-programs) should review the specific GPA requirements on their transfer pathway page.

After reviewing the recommended resources, choose the best available coursework at your current institution to meet transfer application requirements. An official transfer credit evaluation is only available after a student receives an offer of admission from Georgia Tech.

The [Georgia Tech catalog](https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/) is the best resource for degree requirements and course descriptions for each academic major. We also recommend students review our [transfer credit page](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/transfer-credit) to learn more about Tech’s transfer equivalency table.
