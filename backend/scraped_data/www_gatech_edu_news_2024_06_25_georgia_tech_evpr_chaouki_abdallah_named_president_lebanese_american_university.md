Abdallah, MSECE 1982, Ph.D. ECE 1988, has served as EVPR since 2018; in this role, he led extraordinary growth in Georgia Tech’s research enterprise. Through the work of the [Georgia Tech Research Institute](https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/), [10 interdisciplinary research institutes](https://research.gatech.edu/interdisciplinary-research-institutes) (IRIs) and a broad portfolio of faculty research, Georgia Tech now stands [at No. 17 in the nation in research expenditures](https://research.gatech.edu/feature/gt-rankings-jump#:~:text=December%2018%2C%202023%20%E2%80%94%20In%20the,for%20the%20past%20two%20years.) — and No. 1 among institutions without a medical school.

Additionally, Abdallah has also overseen Tech’s economic development activities through the Enterprise Innovation Institute and such groundbreaking entrepreneurship programs as CREATE-X, VentureLab, and the Advanced Technology Development Center.

Under Abdallah's strategic, thoughtful leadership, Georgia Tech strengthened its research partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities, [launched the New York Climate Exchange](https://news.gatech.edu/news/2023/04/24/georgia-tech-chosen-partner-institution-world-leading-climate-center) with a focus on accelerating climate change solutions, [established an AI Hub](https://ai.gatech.edu/) to boost research and commercialization in artificial intelligence, advanced biomedical research (including three research awards from ARPA-H), and elevated the Institute’s annual impact on Georgia’s economy to a record $4.5 billion.

Prior to Georgia Tech, Abdallah served as the 22nd president of the University of New Mexico (UNM), where he also had been provost, executive vice president of academic affairs, and chair of the electrical and computer engineering department. At UNM, he oversaw long-range academic planning, student success initiatives, and improvements in retention and graduation rates.

A national search will be conducted for Abdallah’s replacement. In the coming weeks, President Ángel Cabrera will name an interim EVPR.
