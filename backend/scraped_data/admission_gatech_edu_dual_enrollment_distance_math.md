## Undergraduate Admission

## Distance Math Programs

We offer advanced math to students who have taken AP Calculus BC and have qualifying scores on the exam. Through a partnership with more than 100 Georgia high schools, students in this program can enjoy the challenge of a college class without leaving their high school.

Lectures are pre-recorded and available to students in a learning management system. Students are expected to view three lecture recordings each week, and instructors will teach live studio sessions twice a week, on Monday and Wednesday, from 8:25 to 9:15 AM.

Studio sessions will also be recorded for review or for students who do not attend live sessions. Students must take proctored tests 4 to 5 times per course on specific dates which are announced at the beginning of the semester.

### Distance Math Year One

Students who have completed AP Calculus BC may apply to take this two-course program that includes:

- Math 1554 : Linear Algebra (Fall)

- Math 2551: Multivariable Calculus (Spring)


For students who wish to apply with alternative Calculus courses:

We will consider students who have dual enrollment Calculus courses that transfer to Georgia Tech as MATH 1551 and MATH 1552.

Students may apply with alternative high school Calculus courses only if AP Calculus BC is not available to them in their high school

### Distance Math Year Two

Students who have completed Distance Math Year One may apply to take this two-course program that includes:

- Math 3012: Applied Combinatorics (Fall)

- Math 2552: Differential Equations (Spring)


## Competitive Admission and Prerequisites

Each year, we receive more applications than we have spaces in the program. Meeting minimum admission requirements does not guarantee admission.

### Distance Math Year One

- Pre-requisites: AP Calculus BC course with exam score of 4 or 5, or dual enrollment courses that transfer as MATH 1551 and MATH 1552

- Two college-level courses completed (AP, DE, IB)

- 3.5 unweighted GPA

- 3.5 unweighted math GPA


### Distance Math Year Two

- Pre-requisites: Distance Math Year One

- 3.5 unweighted GPA

- 3.5 unweighted math GPA
