# Fraternal Excellence Awards

In celebration of Georgia Tech’s 134-year-old fraternity and sorority community, the Fraternal Excellence Awards is an annual celebration of Georgia Tech’s Fraternity and Sorority Life. The ceremony provides community members and chapters an opportunity to be recognized by their peers and acknowledged for their hard work. Awards are presented by the department, all four governing councils, and leadership organizations within Fraternity and Sorority Life. **Attire is formal for formal banquet layout.**

The Fraternal Excellence Awards ceremony is also under the umbrella of Student Celebration Week! Launched in 2020, units from the Division of Student Engagement & Well-Being, Institute Communications, and the Office of Graduate Studies collaborate to bring together unique student recognition ceremonies to create a cohesive Student Celebration Week. This week honors all of our students who champion campus engagement and help build a thriving GT community through their leadership, service, and scholarship.
