**Step 1:  Due Dates for the On-Line Application for Graduation**

On-line Applications for Graduation are due the semester BEFORE you plan to graduate. A different on-line application for graduation is due for every semester that you attempt to graduate. If you do not graduate when planned, you must fill out another on-line application for graduation.

On-line Application for Graduation due dates are:

- **Spring 2025 Graduation**: September 2 - January 3, 2025
- **Summer 2025 Graduation:** January 22 - May 9, 2025
- **Summer 2025 Graduation and Walk in Spring Graduation**: Due early March 14, 2025

  - You must apply to graduate AND fill out a separate on-line form is required if you want to graduate in the summer but walk through spring graduation.  Check the link below for exact dates.  Information will be updated at the end of January.

[Early Walk Request for Summer Graduates](https://commencement.gatech.edu/graduate-checklist)

- **Fall 2025 Graduation**: January 22 - August 15, 2025 (subject to change)

**Step 2:  Request to Graduate by using the On-line Application for Graduation**

- The [steps to apply to graduate with images](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/instructions-submitting-online-application-graduation-oag) can be found on the registrar's website.


  - Go to [Buzzport.](https://buzzport.gatech.edu/)
  - Select **Registration - OSCAR**.
  - Select **Student Services & Financial Aid**, then **Student Records** and then **Apply to Graduate**.
  - If you are asked to **Select the Current Term**, then select the current semester in the drop down box. Do not select your graduation term here. Press **Continue**.
  - You will then go through screens where you verify your curriculum, select your graduation term, verify the name on the diploma and your diploma mailing address.  The last screen is a survey that we ask all students to fill out.
- If your concentration or minor are not correct on the _Curriculum Selection_ screen, they must be fixed immediately after you apply to graduate.

  - **Catalog Year:** If you have decided to move to the new ME curriculum, your catalog year must be changed accordingly.  This can be done by filing out a [change of major form](http://www.registrar.gatech.edu/students/formlanding/changemajor.php). You can see which catalog year you are on by looking at your [DegreeWorks audit](https://degreeaudit.gatech.edu/).
  - **Major**: If your primary or secondary majors are not correct, then you must fill out a [change of major form](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/change-major-form-undergraduate-students) to correct it before you can apply to graduate.
  - **Minor**: If your minor is not declared, is not correct or if you are no longer pursuing a minor, you must fill out a [change of minor](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/change-minor-form) form to correct it.
  - **Concentrations**:  If you are pursing a concentration, [you must declare your concentration in OSCAR](http://www.degreeworks.gatech.edu/images/training/concentration_mgt.pdf).
- Important Things to Note
  - Students who have two majors can only select one major at a time; you will need to complete this entire process for both majors.
  - If you use a different name on the Diploma Name Selection screen, the registrar’s office will review all name change requests.
  - On the Diploma Mailing Address Selectin screen, select the address where you want to send your diploma.  NOTE: Diplomas are mailed approximately 8 weeks after graduation so plan accordingly.
- Graduation Requirements
  - **Changing your Graduation Term** \- If you need to change your graduation term, send your advisor an e-mail asking that your on-line application for degree be changed to inactive for the term. This must be done before drop day of the semester you petitioned to graduate, but the sooner the better. A new on-line reapplication for graduation must be submitted for the new semester which you plan to graduate.
  - **The 36 Hour Rule** \- A student's last 36 hours must be taken in residence at Georgia Tech. Students who plan to take a class at another university within the last 36 hours must [Petition the Faculty](http://www.registrar.gatech.edu/students/formlanding/pettofac.php) to ask for a waiver to this rule PRIOR to taking the class.
  - **The 10 Year Rule** \- Course work over 10 years old will not be used toward a BS degree. Students with course work more than 10 years old must [Petition the Faculty](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/petition-faculty) to use the old coursework.
  - **39 Hour Rule** \- A bachelor's degree program must require at least 21 credit hours of upper division courses in the major field and at least 39 credit hours of upper division work overall.
- Graduation Survey - If you do not complete the Institute Graduation Survey and want to return to it at a later time, [use this link to complete the survey](https://surveys.gatech.edu/exit-survey).

**Step 3. Verify that Your On-line Application for Graduation was Correctly Submitted**

- Go to [DegreeWorks](https://degreeaudit.gatech.edu/).
- If you correctly applied to graduate, you can see it on the DegreeWorks audit in the Graduation Information box. [Click here for a screen shot with more information](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/3jmm13ugnf2oh88l28iiq/GraduationScreenshot.png?rlkey=80um8bzpw7gyv4vm6z9ntgb2b&st=jnlkr362&dl=0).

  - If you have not applied correctly, your graduation information will be blank.  It takes ~24 hours to see your status in DegreeWorks.
  - When you initially apply, your graduation information will say **Active Application - Received, Pending Evaluation**.
  - After the registrar audits your status, about 2-3 months into your last semester, your graduation information will state your status.  If you are cleared for graduation, then your Graduation Information box will say **Active Application - On Track to Grad, 2nd Audit**.

**Step 4. Minors, Certificates, Concentrations and the International Plan Forms Must be Submitted (if applicable)**

- **Minors** \- Minor requirements are listed in DegreeWorks.  To declare a minor, use the [minor declaration form](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/change-minor-form).  Minors are noted on your transcript, but they are not on your diploma.
- **Certificates** \- Certificate forms are turned in directly to the [department offering the certificate](https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/#certificatestext), usually a month before you graduate.  Ask the department offering the certificate for their form.  Certificates do not show up on your diploma or transcript.
- **International Plan** \- All IP students who plan to complete the program must submit the [International Plan Degree Designation Form](https://oie.gatech.edu/content/international-plan?qt-ip_quicktabs=5#qt-ip_quicktabs) to OIE. This IP form requires an IP signature and your [academic advisor's](https://me.gatech.edu/academic-advisors-0) signature BEFORE you turn it in.  The International Plan is a degree designator and will show up on your diploma and on your transcript.
- **Concentrations** \- No form must be filled out, you just need to make sure that your [concentration is declared in OSCAR](http://www.degreeworks.gatech.edu/images/training/concentration_mgt.pdf).  Currently concentrations will not show up on your diploma or on your transcript.

**Step 5. Review Your DegreeWorks Audit**

- All students must review their DegreeWorks audit, the system that is used to verify you are eligible to graduate. It is completely your responsibility to verify your DegreeWorks audit is correct and all of the requirements are met.
- Log into [DegreeWorks](https://degreeaudit.gatech.edu/).
- After you log on, you will see your degree audit.  If you have any questions about it, then contact your [academic advisor](https://me.gatech.edu/academic-advisors-0).
- All free electives must be approved even if they fill in on DegreeWorks. Free electives cannot duplicate any of your other classes required for the BSME degree.

**Step 6. Monitoring Your Graduation Status**

- Degree Certification will conduct 2 audits of your application. Below is a breakdown of the timing of the audits:
  - _Application Received_– When you initially apply, your graduation information will say **Active Application - Received, Pending Evaluation**.  It will stay this way until about 2-3 months into your last semester.
  - _Second Audit_ – About 2-3 months into your last semester, your graduation information will be updated.  If you are cleared for graduation, then your Graduation Information box will say **Active Application - On Track to Grad, 2nd Audit**.
  - _Third (Final) Audit_ \- The final audit occurs on the Tuesday following Commencement, after all of the semester grades are available.

- To view your graduation status,
  - Log into [DegreeWorks](https://degreeaudit.gatech.edu/).
  - Near the top of your audit, under a section titled **Student View**, you will see a field **Graduation Information**. The text that appears in that field is your current degree status.
  - [Click here for a screen shot with more information](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/3jmm13ugnf2oh88l28iiq/GraduationScreenshot.png?rlkey=80um8bzpw7gyv4vm6z9ntgb2b&dl=0).

**Step 7. Graduation Honors**

- Honors on your diploma will be based on your final grades, but honors at graduation will be based on your grades as of the semester prior to graduation.
- In order to eligible for honors you must earn 60 credit hours at Georgia Tech. If you do not have 60 credit hours you will not be eligible for any honors, regardless of your GPA.
- [Click here for the honors levels and GPA requirements for each level](http://catalog.gatech.edu/rules/13/).

**Step 8. Graduation Information**

- The [commencement website](https://commencement.gatech.edu/) contains information about the following:


  - Degree candidate frequently asked questions
  - Tickets - they are required to attend the ceremony
  - Caps and gowns
  - Graduation announcements
  - Class rings

* * *

**Summer Graduation**

- There is no commencement ceremony in the summer semester.
- Summer degree candidates are invited to participate in the fall semester commencement ceremony.  All summer graduates wishing to participate in the fall ceremony must submit an RSVP during fall semester to receive guest tickets and participate in the ceremony.
- Undergraduates who have two or fewer classes remaining to complete degree requirements after the spring term and are in good standing may ask to participate in the spring ceremony.  These students are required to apply during a special window in March.  This option is subject to change, depending on space available at graduation.
- Information about how to walk through spring graduation is available each year on [Georgia Tech's commencement website](https://commencement.gatech.edu/).
