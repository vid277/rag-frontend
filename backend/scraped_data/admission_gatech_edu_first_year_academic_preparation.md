## Academic Preparation

When evaluating your application for first-year admission, we are very interested in understanding how you stretched and challenged yourself relative to the curriculum that was available at your school. Georgia Tech is looking for students who demonstrate intellectual curiosity and aren’t afraid of a challenge!

You should demonstrate success in the most rigorous curriculum available at your high school, which includes, but is not limited to:

- Advanced Placement (AP)
- International Baccalaureate (IB)
- [AS & A Levels](https://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate/credit-tests-scores/a-levels/)
- Dual Enrollment

### Required High School Credits

The University System of Georgia (USG) requires [minimum academic courses](https://www.usg.edu/student_affairs/assets/student_affairs/documents/Staying_on_Course.pdf) of all first-time students, though most applicants exceed these in at least one area. USG requirements include:

- English - 4 Units
- Math - 4 Units
- Science - 4 Units
- Social Science - 3 Units
- Foreign Language or American Sign Language or Computer Science - 2 Units

### GPA Evaluation Criteria

The GPA we consider is the one taken directly from your high school transcript. We will use a 100-point GPA, if available, and weighted, if available. If not, we’re happy to consider a 4.0 GPA or similar and/or unweighted GPA.

If your high school does not provide a GPA or you have attended multiple high schools, we will recalculate a weighted 4.0 GPA (0.5 points added for AP, IB, Dual Enrollment, AS & A Levels) using core courses only.

To help us better understand your high school and its curriculum, your counselor will submit a School Report form and/or School Profile with your transcript.

Students attending high school outside the United States can learn more about how we will review your school records [here](https://admission.gatech.edu/international/first-year).

## Submitting Transcripts

* * *

We encourage your school counselor to submit supporting documents electronically, if possible. Additionally, you may upload an unofficial high school transcript via your admission portal after application submission. If you are admitted and choose to enroll at Georgia Tech you will be required to submit an official, final high school transcript.
