# Bridging the Digital Divide in Hawai’i

Feb 25

Written By 
Computer science is rapidly becoming an essential skill for the workforce of today and the future. However, in Hawai‘i, efforts to integrate CS education face unique challenges. From a severe shortage of qualified teachers to cultural mismatches in standardized curricula, the state is grappling with preparing students for a tech-driven world while preserving its rich heritage. [Dr. Josiah Hester](https://research.gatech.edu/people/josiah-hester) and his team at Georgia Tech’s [Ka Moamoa Lab](https://kamoamoa.com/) are working to address these issues by developing emerging technology solutions tailored for Hawaiian immersion schools.

**The Challenge of Computer Science Education in Hawai‘i**

Hawai‘i’s push toward CS education has gained momentum in recent years, particularly with the passage of Acts 51 and 158. These laws mandate the integration of computer science into K-12 curricula statewide by 2025. While well-intentioned, the rapid rollout of these initiatives has exacerbated existing resource gaps, particularly in Kaiapuni (Hawaiian language immersion) schools.

Many schools in Hawai‘i struggle with teacher shortages, particularly in CS education, where subject-matter expertise is scarce. Low teacher salaries, compounded by the high cost of living, have led to high turnover rates and reliance on stand-in educators who often lack the cultural and technical knowledge needed to sustain effective instruction. For Hawaiian immersion schools, this issue is even more pronounced. Substitute teachers unfamiliar with ‘Ōlelo Hawai‘i (Hawaiian language) frequently break the immersion experience, disrupting students’ connection to their heritage.

Adding to these challenges is the Western-centric design of most CS education platforms. Tools such as Scratch and Google Classroom, though widely used, were never designed for Kamaʻāina (those born in Hawaii but not Native Hawaiian) or Kānaka Maoli (Native Hawaiians), and fail to incorporate Hawaiian cultural values, language, and knowledge systems, further alienating students from the material.

**Human-Centered Computing in Hawaiian Classrooms**

Dr. Hester, a Native Hawaiian who grew up in the islands before pursuing a career in computer science, was the only Native Hawaiian to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2017 and was recently one of two Georgia Tech faculty honored with a  Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. government on outstanding scientists and engineers early in their careers, for his work on reliable computer systems and sustainable computing.  As one of the few Native Hawaiian Computing Professors in the USA, Hester feels it his _kuleana_, or responsibility, to ensure that CS education is accessible, engaging, and culturally relevant for local students, offering incredible opportunities for work and impact. His lab’s research takes an assets-based approach, which centers on leveraging existing community strengths rather than imposing external solutions. By collaborating with the community directly, emerging technologies like AI, cyber-physical systems, and sensors can be included in accessible solutions that can serve the community for years to come.

His team’s collaboration with Pūʻōhala School, a Hawaiian language immersion public school on Oʻahu, exemplifies this philosophy. They are developing a teacher-support platform integrating emerging technologies—such as AI-powered learning assistants—with culturally resonant content. This includes incorporating Hawaiian proverbs, place-based learning, and language integration to ensure that students and teachers see their identities reflected in the curriculum.

One key feature of the platform is its ability to support stand-in teachers, who often lack the background to teach CS through a Hawaiian cultural lens. By offering guided lesson plans, interactive tools in ‘Ōlelo Hawai‘i, and AI-driven support, the platform aims to bridge the knowledge gap and maintain continuity in students’ education, even when regular teachers are absent.

**Overcoming AI Hesitancy and Building Tech Fluency**

Despite the promise of AI and emerging technology in education, many teachers in Hawai‘i are hesitant to adopt these tools. Concerns range from data sovereignty—particularly in Indigenous communities where cultural knowledge has historically been exploited—to fears that AI will replace rather than augment teaching.

Hester’s approach is not about imposing technology but rather about adapting it to meet the needs of Hawaiian educators. His team actively engages teachers in co-designing the platform, ensuring that the technology is a culturally sensitive aid rather than an intrusive force.

“They should know about computing and AI because it is pervasive. Native Hawaiians were tool builders and technology adopters from the very beginning,” Hester emphasizes. He believes that by equipping teachers with the right tools, they can, in turn, empower students to navigate and shape the future of technology rather than being passive consumers of it.

**A Model for Other Indigenous Communities**

Beyond Hawai‘i, the research conducted by Hester and his team has implications for other indigenous communities facing similar educational challenges. By developing frameworks that integrate emerging technology with cultural values, they are laying the groundwork for more inclusive and effective CS education worldwide.

Hawai‘i’s battle against brain drain—where local talent leaves the islands for better opportunities elsewhere—makes initiatives like this even more urgent. By fostering a strong foundation in computing at a young age and making it relevant to students’ cultural experiences, Hester hopes to inspire the next generation of Hawaiian technologists to build their futures at home.

Hawai‘i has approached its 2025 deadline for implementing the CS curriculum, making the work being done at the Ka Moamoa Lab more critical than ever. By developing support tools that respect and incorporate Hawaiian language and traditions, Hester’s research ensures that the next wave of computer scientists will be technically proficient and deeply connected to their cultural roots.

Through this effort, Hester and his team are proving that technology and tradition do not have to be at odds. They can empower communities to thrive in an increasingly digital world when thoughtfully integrated.
