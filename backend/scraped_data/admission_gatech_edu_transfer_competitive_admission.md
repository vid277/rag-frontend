### How Does Georgia Tech Review Applications?

Each year, Georgia Tech must make fine distinctions among large numbers of highly qualified applicants. The ability to assess consistently all information presented in the application becomes increasingly important.

Therefore, the Office of Undergraduate Admission employs a rigorous review process in order to provide an individualized and holistic evaluation of every application. Each applicant is assessed on the basis of achievements and potential in a broad range of categories, viewed in the context of the opportunities and challenges the applicant faced.

These categories include:

- Strength of educational performance and potential for academic success, as measured by the nature and rigor of curriculum and academic achievements.

- Potential to contribute to the overall intellectual climate and make a positive contribution to campus and community life.

- Demonstrated commitment to intellectual engagement.
