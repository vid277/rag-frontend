## Document Submission

**Georgia Tech recommends electronic document submission whenever possible.** Our goal is to process documents as quickly as possible; we know that is what you expect. At our busiest times of year, specifically surrounding deadlines, it may take up to two weeks from the time we receive documents for processing for updates to appear in your Admission Portal.

### Mailing Address

If using a mail delivery service, we recommend a trackable method of mailing such as delivery confirmation or priority mailing. Be sure to list our entire mailing address below.

### First-Year Applicants

## High School Transcripts (required)

High School Transcripts should be sent electronically via [Common App](https://www.commonapp.org/explore/georgia-institute-technology) or through another service, such as [Parchment](https://www.parchment.com/order/my-credentials/), [SCOIR](https://www.scoir.com/), [SLATE](https://slate.org/), [Naviance](https://www.naviance.com/), [Maia Learning](https://www.maialearning.com/), or [GA Futures](https://www.gafutures.org/). Check with your school to see which service they use. If electronic delivery is not available at your school, then they should send the transcript via mail.

## College Transcripts (required for Dual Enrollment credit)

College transcripts are required for application review if your high school transcript does not list dual enrollment classes and/or grades. If you are an enrolling student, a final official college transcript is required for all coursework for which you are seeking credit.

Send transcripts electronically from the University Registrar through an approved service (e.g. [Parchment](https://www.parchment.com/order/my-credentials/), [National Student Clearinghouse](https://www.studentclearinghouse.org/), [SCOIR](https://www.scoir.com/), etc.). Select "Georgia Tech" or "Georgia Institute of Technology" as the recipient of the document. If an email address is required for electronic submission, use [appdocs@admission.gatech.edu](mailto:appdocs@admission.gatech.edu).

If electronic delivery is not available, please mail the transcript to our office.

## Standardized Test Scores

You may self-report standardized test scores (SAT, ACT, AP, etc) on your Common Application or Dual Enrollment application. After application submission, you can also self-report scores through your Admission Portal. We will consider self-reported scores within our application review process.

Official SAT/ACT scores are required of students who enroll at Georgia Tech. AP, IB, A-level or similar scores are required for students seeking college credit. Official test scores must be sent directly to Georgia Tech via the testing agency (SAT code 5248, ACT code 0818). We do not recommend paying the expedited rush fee. In our experience, scores arrive at roughly the same time whether you pay for them to be rushed or not.

### Transfer and Non-Degree Applicants

An official college transcript from each previous institution is required for application review. Send transcripts electronically from the University Registrar through an approved service (e.g. [Parchment](https://www.parchment.com/order/my-credentials/), [National Student Clearinghouse](https://www.studentclearinghouse.org/), [SCOIR](https://www.scoir.com/), etc.). Select "Georgia Tech" or "Georgia Institute of Technology" as the recipient of the document. If an email address is required for electronic submission, use [appdocs@admission.gatech.edu](mailto:appdocs@admission.gatech.edu).

If electronic delivery is not available, please mail the transcript to our office.
