# Welcome Wreck Program Supports New Research Faculty Hires

Jun 04, 2024


Research faculty now make up nearly [60% of Georgia Tech’s faculty](https://news.gatech.edu/news/2024/04/02/empowering-research-faculty-georgia-techs-strategic-plan) population, and of the full-time, non-GTRI faculty, more than 25% are research faculty. However, this growing subset of the faculty often misses out on traditional welcome experiences because of year-round onboarding. The Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty aims to change that with the launch of the new [Welcome Wreck](https://faculty.gatech.edu/faculty-resources/research-faculty/welcome-wreck) program.

Welcome Wreck pairs seasoned research faculty ambassadors with newcomers to provide support and ready access to community during the start of a research faculty member’s career at Georgia Tech. Created by the College of Computing and Institute for People and Technology’s **Carrie Bruce,** and supported by the Center for Inclusive Design and Innovation’s **Zerrin Ondin-Fraser**, Welcome Wreck launched in May with eight ambassadors representing a range of Schools and units across campus.

Inaugural ambassadors include:

- **Maribeth Gandy Coleman**— Regents’ Researcher, Institute for People and Technology

- **Christine Conwell** —Director of Planning and Operations, Strategic Energy Institute

- **Elena Garcia** —Senior Research Engineer, Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory

- **Anthony Giarrusso** —Senior Research Scientist, Center for Spatial Planning Analytics and Visualization

- **Salimah LaForce** —Senior Policy Analyst, Center for Advanced Communications Policy

- **Jeonghyun (Jonna) Lee** —Director of Research in Education Innovation, Division of Lifetime Learning

- **Noah Posner**— Research Scientist, Institute for People and Technology, School of Industrial Design

- **Jeff Young** —Senior Research Scientist, School of Computer Science

“Georgia Tech’s community of research faculty now numbers more than 500 non-GTRI employees,” said **Coleman**, who also serves as the interim assistant vice provost for Research Faculty. “This is an incredible opportunity to create a warm welcome and important connections for new members of our community, as well as connections across units for those senior research faculty who have been Yellow Jackets for some time.”
