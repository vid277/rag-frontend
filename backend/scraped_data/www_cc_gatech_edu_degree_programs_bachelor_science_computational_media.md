## Bachelor of Science in Computational Media

Computation Through Expression and Communication

* * *

Do you love computation with a dash of art and creativity? Do music technology and communications fascinate you, as well?

Students in Georgia Tech’s Bachelor of Science in Computational Media (BSCM) program combine these passions to carve a distinct path in which they are uniquely positioned to create and engage with digital media for entertainment, music, education, and business.

The BSCM degree program was developed in recognition of computing’s significant role in communication and expression and is a joint offering between the College of Computing and the School of Literature, Media, and Communication within the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and the School of Music within the College of Design.

Students gain both theoretical and hands-on knowledge of computing while developing an in-depth understanding of visual design, music technology, or the history of media.
