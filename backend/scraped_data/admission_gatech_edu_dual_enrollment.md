## Dual Enrollment

Georgia Tech offers dual enrollment to advance the educational opportunities of Georgia students. Our program intends to enrich the high school experience, not replace it. Students who take classes at Georgia Tech usually continue taking classes and participating in activities and organizations in their high school communities.

**Distance Math and On-Campus Dual Enrollment programs admit students for fall semester only.** If you are admitted for fall semester, you may enroll in spring semester courses pending satisfactory academic performance in the fall. **Distance Computer Science admits students for Summer, Fall, or Spring semesters.** That program includes one-semester courses and students may take one or more.

Distance Math Programs

Most of our dual enrollment students are in Distance Math. We partner with more than 90 high schools in Georgia to offer this program.

## How to Apply for Dual Enrollment

* * *

The dual enrollment admission process is selective. Each year, we have more qualified students apply for admission than we have spaces in our programs.
