## Ferris-Goldsmith Trading Floor

Where Tech Square Meets Wall Street

Opened in 2006, the 2,000-square-foot Trading Floor in the Scheller College of Business building is used to train students to use financial analysis and electronic trading tools and prepare them for careers in investment banking and financial services.

The Trading Floor is used in finance courses for undergraduate, MBA, and QCF programs. It is also the setting for Georgia Tech's Wall Street on West Peachtree Program, a summer enrichment program enabling local high school students to learn the fundamentals of finance, investments, and financial management.
