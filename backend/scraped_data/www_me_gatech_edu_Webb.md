Founded in 1999, the Webb Communication Program provides communication training at all educational levels within the Woodruff School. The Program aligns with the Woodruff School’s mission by equipping engineers to effectively communicate solutions and their social implications, driving action and change to address society’s most pressing challenges.

## The technical communicator's job is to transfer                              information to their audience with the smallest   cognitive load while still being trustworthy and   actionable.

_\- programmatic tenet_

Training in the Webb Program focuses on guiding students as they learn to discern and communicate usable engineering information by focusing on preparing engineers to be communication decision-makers who can assess situations and respond appropriately by doing the following:

- _Determining Trustworthiness Threshold_
- _Determining Actionability Threshold_
- _Balancing Cognitive Load and Content_

- _Discerning Usable Information from Extraneous Data_
- _Leveraging Genre Expectation_

### Webb-Donnell Communication Competitions

Jeff Donnell, former principal academic professional in the Woodruff School was named the first Frank K. Webb Academic Professional Chair in Communication Skills and held this position until his passing in 2022. Frank K. Webb and Jeff Donnell both recognized the importance of training engineers with effective communication tools.

Students have the opportunity to explore the importance of communication in their research by participating in the annual Webb-Donnell Communication Competitions.

Information regarding the [annual communication competitions](https://www.me.gatech.edu/webb-donnell-communication-competitions) will be posted at the beginning of every spring semester.
