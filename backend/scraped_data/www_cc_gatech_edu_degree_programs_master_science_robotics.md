# Master of Science in Robotics

According to the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, automation and robotics is expected to be a primary area of growth in Georgia over the next decade. This increasing demand drives a need for experienced, educated, and qualified professionals to serve and lead in these increasingly automated industrial and service-oriented environments. To meet this growing demand, the Georgia Institute of Technology has developed a new professional interdisciplinary master’s Program in Robotics.

* * *

This 36 credit-hour, cohort-based program is a professional [Master of Science in Robotics](http://robotics.gatech.edu/roboticsMS) over four semesters designed to produce industry-ready engineers and scientists with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills needed to meet the challenges of rapidly growing interdisciplinary technologies in professional careers related to designing and developing robotics and automation solutions.  Such a program is in high demand by not only students but also a growing list of local and global companies interested in robotics and factory automation.

The MS Robotics program provides its graduates with a practitioner-oriented degree that clearly distinguishes them as trained professionals in the field. Its curriculum is specifically tailored to the educational needs for robotics professionals by requiring courses in multiple core areas of Robotics (e.g., AI and Mechanics). In addition to coursework, the students will spend a summer performing internship at one of our industrial robotics partners, and complete a capstone project providing them with practical experience directly applicable to their careers.

### How to Apply

The MS-Robotics program is offered collaboratively by six schools in the Colleges of Computing, Engineering and Sciences:

- [Electrical & Computer Engineering](http://ece.gatech.edu/)
- [Mechanical Engineering](http://me.gatech.edu/)
- [Aerospace Engineering](http://ae.gatech.edu/)
- [Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.gatech.edu/)
- [Interactive Computing](http://www.ic.gatech.edu/)
- [Physics](https://physics.gatech.edu/)

Students can apply to the MS-Robotics program through any of the six participating schools, the choice of which usually reflects that student's intended area of specialization and general background. Students with diverse and eclectic backgrounds are encouraged to apply, including those with previous work or research experience. Each school has its own set of admission criteria but the program generally requires a minimum GPA of 3.3.

### Program of Study

The program requires 36 hours of letter-grade coursework with a minimum GPA of 3.0. A maximum of two classes (6 semester hours) at the 4000 level (undergraduate) may be used as free electives toward the required 36 credit hours. The students are encouraged to select additional elective courses from the diverse offerings available at Georgia Tech.
