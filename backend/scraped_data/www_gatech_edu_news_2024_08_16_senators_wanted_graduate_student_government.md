# Senators Wanted for Graduate Student Government

Aug 16, 2024


Graduate students interested in representing their College and enhancing the graduate student experience are invited to consider running for the Graduate Student Senate.

The [Graduate Student Senate](https://www.sga.gatech.edu/grad-legislative/) is the most direct way to recommend and realize solutions to improve life at Georgia Tech for graduate students.

The legislative branch of the [Graduate Student Government Association](https://www.sga.gatech.edu/graduate-student-government-association/) (GSGA) meets weekly to:

- Represent their School and College in the Graduate Student Senate.

- Propose and pass bills affecting graduate student life.

- Advocate on behalf of the graduate student body toward the Georgia Tech administration.

As stated in the GSGA constitution, graduate students must meet the requirements outlined in the Georgia Tech catalog for participation in extracurricular activities to be eligible to run for the position of senator. Students registered with the Center for Career Discovery and Development for a work term in the fall or spring are eligible to serve as Co-op senators but may not serve as senators.

This year, senators will meet in person every Friday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. in Room 117, Smithgall Student Services (Flag) Building.

Students interested in running should [fill out this form](https://b.gatech.edu/3LZ5Or3) by Tuesday, Aug. 27, at 11:59 a.m. All fields must be completed to be eligible. Elections will take place from Aug. 28 through Sept. 2.

If elected, senators are expected to serve until the Fall 2025 elections or until they graduate, whichever occurs earlier.

Online students hoping to represent and advocate for their peers should consider joining the Online Student Affairs Executive Committee. [Apply here](https://b.gatech.edu/4dCDQgF).
