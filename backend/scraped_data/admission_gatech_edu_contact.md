## Contact Our Office

In order to help our admission staff balance inquiries and daily communication with their office responsibilities and application review, all incoming calls and emails are routed to our Communication Center, led by an Admission Advisor and a team of experienced student representatives.

- **Prospective Families:** The Communication Center is trained to answer most questions from prospective students/families and will forward to an available Admission Advisor, if needed.

- **Applicants:** Questions about the status of your application will likely be answered by our Communication Center staff. More detailed questions will be forwarded to the appropriate admission staff member.

- **Counselors:** Communication Center staff will be able to direct you to an appropriate admission staff member, as needed.


_Please note: we do not consider demonstrated interest in our first-year, dual enrollment, or transfer application review._
