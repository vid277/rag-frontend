# Search Begins for Georgia Tech’s Executive Vice President for Research

Sep 03, 2024


President Ángel Cabrera has convened a search committee, chaired by College of Sciences Dean Susan Lozier, charged with selecting Georgia Tech’s next executive vice president for research (EVPR). To assist with the process, the Institute has retained the services of executive search firm WittKieffer.

“I thank all the members of the search committee and committee chair Dean Lozier, for conducting a thorough search to identify our next executive vice president for research,” said President Cabrera. “As one of the nation’s foremost academic research institutions, Georgia Tech is looking for a leader who can sustain the growth of our research enterprise, build the infrastructure necessary to support it, and deliver on our mission to advance technology and improve the human condition.”

WittKieffer will host several town halls to gather input from the Georgia Tech community on the preferred qualifications of the next EVPR.
