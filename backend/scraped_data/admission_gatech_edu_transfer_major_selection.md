## Major Selection

During our holistic review process we consider many factors, including the major listed on your application. We seek to enroll an academically-diverse class so transfer students are admitted directly into the major listed on the transfer application. In our review of your application we expect to see that your course selection and activities demonstrate interest in the major that you list on your application.

## Change of Major Policy

* * *

Admitted transfer students may pursue a formal change of major after their first semester. However, requesting a major change requires the approval of all academic colleges and departments involved, and is not guaranteed, especially for high demand majors.
