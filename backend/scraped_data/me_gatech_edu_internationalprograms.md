### **Georgia Tech-Europe, France**

Established as Georgia Institute of Technology’s first international campus in 1990 in Metz, France, Georgia Tech-Europe is:

- A highly innovative institution offering year-round undergraduate, masters and Ph.D. programs
- Home to a strong sponsored research program through the _GT-CNRS Unité Mixte Internationale 2958_ (UMI), an international joint laboratory between Georgia Tech and the _French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique_ (CNRS)
- Operator of the Lafayette Institute, an international open-innovation center
- Fully integrated into French and American structures: an affiliate of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and  incorporated under French Law

## Dual Degree Master of Science at Georgia Tech Europe

[Georgia Tech Europe (GTE)](http://lorraine.gatech.edu/) is the European campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in the beautiful and historic city of Metz, France. On this campus, you can complete part or all of your Master's degree.

Since 1997, the School of Mechanical Engineering has developed graduate program partnerships with the following top European universities:  Arts et Metiers Paris Tech, ENSEEIHT, Sapienza University, and Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.  These partnerships allow you to graduate with a second Master's degree from Europe, in addition to your Georgia Tech MSME degree.

On the GTE campus, the admission and graduation requirements for the MSME are exactly the same as those on the GT Atlanta campus.

You also have the opportunity to study for your Ph.D. within the UMI 2958 joint laboratory between the CNRS and the Georgia Institute of Technology.

### **Cooperation Between Georgia Tech and our European Partnership Universities: How the Dual-Degree Program Works**

Georgia Tech has long-term cooperative academic and research agreement with Arts et Metiers Paris Tech (to include its 8 campuses), and with Ecole Nationale Supérieure Electronique Electrotechnique Informatique Hydraulique Telecommunications (ENSEEIHT) for completing a Master’s equivalent degree from France.  Georgia Tech has initiated an academic agreement with Sapienza University di Roma, a leading institution to complete the Master’s degree equivalent from Italy, the Laurea Magistrale. Georgia Tech has initiated an academic agreement with Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, a leading institution to complete the Master’s degree from Spain.

### MSME – GTE Campus Seminar Requirement

Every Fall and Spring semester, a graduate seminar series is offered on the GT Europe Campus. This seminar is open to all students and is a special requirement (not a degree requirement) for all Master students. The objective of this seminar is to allow students to interact directly with their future professional world by inviting GTE corporate partners to present their activities. Students have the opportunity to exchange directly for internships or job opportunities. Participating corporations have GTE alumni that participate in this seminar series and can provide information to students.

## Joint Master of Science with University of Stuttgart

The joint MS degree program includes course work, practical internship, thesis research and thesis defense.

Applicants to the program from the United States should apply through Georgia Tech and those from Europe through the University of Stuttgart. Applicants will have completed, by the time of entering the program, a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering or closely related discipline. In addition, students from the United States should have proficiency with the German language at the level of one undergraduate year of study. Admission to the program will be determined by a joint committee representing both institutions.
