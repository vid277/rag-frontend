# Brittain Dining Hall Closes

Jul 18, 2024


Brittain Dining Hall has been a staple at Georgia Tech for years. Due to the costs required for necessary renovations in the nearly 100-year-old building, [Tech Dining](https://dining.gatech.edu/) made the difficult decision to close the facility for the next year while plans are made to redesign the building.

Ensuring the safety of all students was key in making this decision, as the current space presents infrastructure concerns.

“We understand that Brittain Dining Hall holds a special place in the hearts of many, and its closure is a significant change,” said Ryan Greene, senior director of Tech Dining. “Our team is committed to ensuring that the transition is as smooth as possible, and we are excited about the enhanced services and options now available to our students.”

To accommodate this change, Tech Dining is incorporating several changes:

- [North Avenue Dining Hall](https://dining.gatech.edu/location/north-ave-dining-hall) will now be open 24 hours a day, Monday through Thursday, with 150 additional seats to accommodate more students. This includes ADA-compliant and expanded outdoor seating.
- The [GoFood](https://dining.gatech.edu/gofood) program is being updated to allow students to take out meals up to three times a day, an increase from once daily, to support their busy schedules.
- [Retail locations](https://dining.gatech.edu/dining-locations/campus-retail), including Dunkin’ and Jimmy John’s at the John Lewis Student Center, will have extended hours next semester to further support the dining needs of our community.
- A [robot delivery service](https://students.gatech.edu/news/tech-dining-introduces-starship-technologies-autonomous-delivery-robots) will launch at the beginning of the fall semester to provide on-demand meal delivery.
- Brittain’s executive chef will be transitioning to North Avenue.

[West Village Dining Hall](https://dining.gatech.edu/location/west-village-dining-hall) also continues to be available for dining needs. For more late-night dining options, students can order from Tech Dining’s newest concept, [The Missing T](https://dining.gatech.edu/location/missing-t), which will be open from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.

Campus transit will remain accessible to all traveling to North Avenue, even during extended hours. Construction is underway to improve pedestrian traffic at the intersection of North Avenue and Techwood Drive for safer and more efficient traffic flow.
