# \# Tech Square Phase 3 George Tower

## **George Tower**

### **H. Milton and Carolyn J. Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE)**

## Welcome to the new home of ISyE!

The Tech Square Phase 3 (TS3) initiative is transforming Midtown Atlanta with its impressive 416,500-square-foot high-rise research building. This project features two striking towers: the 18-story George Tower and the 14-story Scheller Tower, connected by a shared elevator and surrounded by a vibrant outdoor plaza for street-level retail.

### George Tower

George Tower, an 18-story marvel, is named in honor of the generous philanthropists Penny and William "Bill" George. This tower will be the new home for the #1 ranked H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, providing an inspiring environment for students and faculty to innovate and excel.

### Scheller Tower

Scheller Tower, a 14-story structure, is named after Ernest "Ernie" Scheller Jr., a principal donor for Tech. It will house the MBA and Executive Education programs for the Scheller College of Business, reflecting a commitment to fostering leadership and business acumen.

“We are excited about moving ISyE’s home to George Tower, placing us at the center of the 'Tech Square Innovation District.' George Tower will offer an ideal setting for us to build on ISyE’s legacy of leadership and excellence in research, education, innovation, and impact. It will also help create new opportunities for strategic partnerships and collaborations. We deeply appreciate the generous support from Bill and Penny George and all of our alumni.”
