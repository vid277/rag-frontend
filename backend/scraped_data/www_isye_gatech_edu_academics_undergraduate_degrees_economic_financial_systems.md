# Economic & Financial Systems Concentration

Economic & Financial Systems

This concentration offers students in-depth knowledge in the allocation of financial resources. The depth courses in this concentration span economic and financial analysis courses. The economic courses provide broad perspectives on using prices and lead-time to influence demand, coordination and competition, among other topics. The financial courses include options, project selection, risk hedging, and break even analysis.

### Group 2 Vertically-Integrated Projects

Please see below for a list of approved and denied VIP projects. If the project in which you are interested is not on this list, please submit the [Course Substitution Form](https://vpn.gatech.edu/https/webforms.isye.gatech.edu/undergraduate-forms/undergraduate-course-substitution "(opens in a new window)") to request that we review it for consideration as a Group 2 Engineering Elective.

To satisfy Group 2 Engineering Elective credit:

- At least three but no more than four credits of VIP coursework must be taken with the same project over 2 consecutive semesters (with exceptions for summer and co-op/internship semesters).
  - View list below for a list of projects already approved or denied
  - Upon completion of at least 3 credit hours of VIP with the same project and in 2 consecutive semesters (with exceptions for summer and co-op/internship semesters), please contact your assigned academic advisor to have the credits moved to Engineering Electives Group 2.
  - VIP counts for free elective if not used for Engineering Elective.

## Environmental Requirements

ISyE requires that a BSIE student have one course that deals with the environment. Accordingly, the following list provides a sample of acceptable courses that satisfy the environmental requirement.

### 4-HOUR LAB SCIENCE REQUIREMENTS:

- BIOS 1107 (was BIOL 1510) - Biological Principles
- BIOS 1220 - Biology of Sex and Death
- EAS 1600 - Introduction to Environmental Science
- EAS 1601 - Habitable Plant
- EAS 2600 - Earth Processes

### SOCIAL SCIENCE ELECTIVES:

- ECON 4440 - Economics of Environment

### ENGINEERING ELECTIVES:

- CEE 2300 - Environmental Engineering Principles
- CEE 4300 - Environmental Engineering Systems
- CP 2233 - Sustainable Urban Development

### FREE ELECTIVES (Courses listed above may be used as free elective as well):

- BIOS 2300 - Ecology
- BIOL 2335 - General Ecology
- EAS 2750 - Physics of the Weather
- EAS 3110 - Energy, Environ, Society
- EAS 4480 - Environ Data Analysis
- ISyE 4501 - Energy, Efficiency, and Sustainability (Offered in Fall Semester, starting in Fall 2018 - replaces ISyE 4803 below)
- (ISyE 4803 - Energy and Environmental Analysis (replaced by ISyE 4501, but will still be accepted))
- PHYS 2750 - Physics of the Weather
- SLS 3120 - Foundations of Sustainable Systems

There are other courses offered at Tech from time to time that will meet this requirement.  If you find a course that you wish to take and feel that the content qualifies, please contact your academic advisor for approval prior to enrolling.

## Matching Courses to Concentrations

To determine your Catalog Year, you will need to access your DegreeWorks (via Buzzport) and then look for the BSIE - Degree Requirements row.  At the end of that row, your Catalog Year is listed above your GPA.

![choosing catalog year](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/catalogyear.png)

### 2019-2020 (and later) Catalog year

The table lists how the various concentration courses can be used to satisfy each concentration's requirements (please refer to the [**curriculum pages**](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate#curriculum) for the other rules that still must be observed):
