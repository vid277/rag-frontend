# Duo Phone Call 2FA Phase Out

Aug 26, 2024


As part of the [Office of Information Technology's](https://oit.gatech.edu/) (OIT) ongoing commitment to strengthen Georgia Tech’s defenses against cyber threats, we implemented the two-factor authentication (2FA) method [Verified Duo Push](https://news.gatech.edu/news/2024/06/21/verified-duo-push-launching-tech-june-24) this past June, significantly improving the integrity of the Institute’s systems. Further, after conducting campus survey and cybersecurity research, OIT has made the decision to no longer offer the Duo Mobile phone call 2FA method for login to Georgia Tech systems, and OneUSG Connect access for campus users, beginning this fall, in two phases.

Beginning Nov. 11, the Duo phone call method will not be offered as a two-factor authentication option for Georgia Tech users when logging in to OneUSG Connect. Beginning Dec. 3, the method will not be offered as a 2FA option for any Georgia Tech login system. The Duo phone call authentication method _will_ remain a recovery mechanism for logging into [Passport](https://passport.gatech.edu/).

With the understanding that some campus members may have constraints and require the continued use of the Duo phone call method, OIT will work with these users on a case-by-case basis. The use of authentication methods such as Verified Duo Push, Duo Passcode, YubiKeys, and passkeys is encouraged. Support teams will be available for one-on-one assistance, through virtual sessions and help desks, to assist users with these methods.

OIT has provided updated resources and video tutorials for setting up Duo Mobile and other authentication methods at [oit.gatech.edu/two-factor-authentication](https://oit.gatech.edu/two-factor-authentication).
