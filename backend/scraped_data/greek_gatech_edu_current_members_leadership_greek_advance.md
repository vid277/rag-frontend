# Greek Advance

The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life has developed a series of development opportunities intentionally situated at different membership points throughout a student's Greek experience at Georgia Tech. Collectively known as Greek Advance, each program is designed to provide tools and resources at every level of membership for students to advance as leaders within their community. To meet students where they are at, there is a program tied to each stage of membership. Some programs are mandatory for all members, and some are optional programs to take advantage of. Learn more about our all-member Greek Advance opportunities below.
