## Undergraduate Admission

## Distance Computer Science Program

Georgia Tech is proud to offer computer science course options for high school students seeking dual enrollment at Tech. To get started, read below about course structures to see what’s right for you.

- Each course is 3 credit hours, and each is offered in summer, fall, and spring semesters

- Online and asynchronous

- Course requirements for each student include:


  - A computer with an attached web camera for proctoring.

  - A quiet place with reliable internet access and access to web browser


- Tests are proctored digitally. Tests in CS 1301 must be taken in a four-day window. Tests in CS 1331 must be taken at specific times and dates provided on the syllabus.


### CS 1301: Introduction to Computing

This introductory computer science course teaches students foundational computing principles, including how to write and read computer code and how to run and debug code. This innovative online course includes recorded lectures, optional recitations, and online discussion forums. Students learn to program in Python. They take four proctored exams at the time of their choosing, each within its own four-day window.

If students receive credit at Georgia Tech with a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Computer Science A exam, this is the course for which they get credit.

## Preview the CS 1301 Course

The CS 1301: Introduction to Computing course covers the following topics:

- The fundamental design cycle of computer science and computer programming: writing code, executing it, interpreting the results, and revising the code syntax based on the outcomes.

- Usage of the fundamental atoms of programming: variables, mathematical operators, logical operators, and boolean arithmetic.

- Control structures for developing dynamic programs, including Python libraries: conditionals, loops, functions, and error handling.

- The core data structures for creating useful programs: strings, lists, dictionaries, and file manipulation.

- Previews of the next big topics in computer science: object-oriented programming skills, and computer algorithms.

### Which class should you choose as a beginning of your Dual Enrollment Computer Science experience?

The primary consideration of your starting point is whether or not you have experience coding in Python, the programming language of CS 1301. Most students who apply to Georgia Tech have experience in Java.

- If this will be your first college computer science credit, you should apply for CS 1301.

- If you have already successfully completed Georgia Tech’s CS 1301 for credit, you will be considered for CS 1331.

- If you have taken AP Computer Science A and have a score of 4 or 5 on the exam, you may choose to start in CS 1301 or CS 1331. Because the programming language of AP Computer Science A is Java and the programming language of CS 1301 is Python, we recommend starting in CS 1331 only if you have also already learned Python.


### Competitive Admission and Prerequisites

Each year, we receive more applications than we have spaces in the program. Meeting minimum admission requirements does not guarantee admission.

**Please be aware that in the last two years, students who applied for Fall semester with a request to take CS 1331 in spring have filled all spaces in that course. We were not able to offer admission to CS 1331 for applicants in the Spring admission round.**

**Distance CS 1301:**

- Prerequisites:


  - Precalculus

  - Experience with computer programming (classes or hobby acceptable)


- Be in 11th or 12th grade.

- Two college-level courses completed (AP, DE, IB), preferably at least one in math or science

- 3.5 unweighted GPA

- 3.5 unweighted math GPA


**Distance CS 1331:**

- Prerequisites:


  - Precalculus

  - CS 1301 or AP Computer Science A course and exam with 4 or 5 and attestation to proficiency with Python


- Be in 11th or 12th grade.

- Two college-level courses completed (AP, DE, IB), preferably at least one in math or science

- 3.5 unweighted GPA

- 3.5 unweighted math GPA
