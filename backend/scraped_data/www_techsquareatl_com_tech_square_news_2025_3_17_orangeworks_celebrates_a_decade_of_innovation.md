Last Friday, for its 10th anniversary, Home Depot’s Innovation Lab, [OrangeWorks](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/about-scheller/tech-square/scheller-goes-inside-the-home-depot.html), opened its doors to the Tech Square community for a special open house. Attendees got a behind-the-scenes look at the company’s cutting-edge research and development efforts. Located in the Centergy Building, OrangeWorks serves as a hub for emerging technology, fostering collaboration among Home Depot teams, Georgia Tech researchers, and the broader innovation ecosystem in Atlanta.

Visitors explored interactive demos, engaged with Home Depot’s innovation team, and gained firsthand insight into how the company harnesses AI, robotics, and advanced materials to redefine retail and home improvement. Student interns at OrangeWorks showcased the lab’s maker space capabilities, guiding attendees through ongoing and past projects, as well as hands-on prototyping. They also highlighted Home Depot’s diverse talent development programs, including internships, apprenticeships, and returnships, designed to support employees and external candidates looking to advance their careers in innovation and technology at Home Depot.

Events like this are crucial for sparking meaningful connections within the Tech Square community, fostering collaboration, and opening doors to potential partnerships between researchers and industry.
