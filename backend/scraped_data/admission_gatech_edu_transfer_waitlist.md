## Undergraduate Admission

## Transfer Waitlist

### Frequently Asked Questions

A limited number of students who apply for transfer admission will be offered a place on our waitlist. We understand you may have questions about timing and other details, and we have answered many of these through the Frequently Asked Questions listed below.

## What does it mean if my admission decision is "waitlist"?

In reviewing your application, it was clear you would be an excellent student at Georgia Tech. However, due to our incoming class size we are unable to accept every student who is capable of being successful on campus. Each year some students who are offered admission do not accept their space. If we do not meet our class goal, we will evaluate our waitlist to fill our class.

## How do I get on the waitlist?

Students offered a place on the waitlist need to **accept or decline their place on the waitlist by logging into their [admission portal](http://application.gatech.edu/apply/status).**

## Will waitlist students be required to submit information?

No additional information will be requested from waitlist students.

## Can students on the waitlist schedule an interview with someone in the admission office?

No. Interviews are not part of the admission process at Georgia Tech.

## Does Georgia Tech rank the waitlist?

No. Georgia Tech does not use a ranking system to make offers from the waitlist. We admit students from the waitlist in an effort to shape our class to meet institutional needs and priorities.

## When will students on the waitlist know if they will receive an admission offer?

We likely will not know if we have met our class goals until after the [deposit deadline](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/deadlines-fees). Our goal is to finalize our transfer class after the [deposit deadline](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/deadlines-fees) as soon as possible.

## Will students accepted from the waitlist get campus housing?

Campus housing is available on a space available basis for all incoming transfer students. Visit the [housing website](https://housing.gatech.edu/) learn more about the application process.

## Are students accepted from the waitlist considered for financial aid?

If you are accepted from the waitlist, the [Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid](https://finaid.gatech.edu/) (OSFA) will notify you of the status of your financial aid application. Once your application is complete, OSFA will provide details about your student aid eligibility. However, the reality is that often financial aid packages available to students offered admission from the waitlist are limited to student loans.
