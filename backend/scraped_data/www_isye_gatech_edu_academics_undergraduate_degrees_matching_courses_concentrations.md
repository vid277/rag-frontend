# Matching Courses to Concentrations

## Matching Courses to Concentrations

To determine your Catalog Year, you will need to access your DegreeWorks (via Buzzport) and then look for the BSIE - Degree Requirements row.  At the end of that row, your Catalog Year is listed above your GPA.

### 2019-2020 (and later) Catalog year

The table lists how the various concentration courses can be used to satisfy each concentration's requirements (please refer to the [**curriculum pages**](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate#curriculum) for the other rules that still must be observed):

**Breadth or** _**blank**_ **\- Course can satisfy as a Breadth course if labeled as a Depth or Reqd for another concentration**
