Following a national search, the Georgia Institute of Technology has selected Leo Howell as its new vice president for Information Technology and chief information officer. Howell has served as interim vice president for Information Technology and chief information officer since Jan. 1.

He will transition to his new permanent role on July 1 and will report directly to Shantay N. Bolton, executive vice president for Administration and Finance.

“We are very pleased that Leo will be leading Georgia Tech’s information technology efforts during this transformative time,” said Bolton. “His years of experience in information technology, including leading solutions for addressing cybersecurity risk at the Institute and his proven record as a collaborator and change agent, will help to bring a superior technology experience to students, faculty, staff, and other constituents.”

In his most recent interim leadership role, Howell has been responsible for guiding the strategic course of the Institute’s IT resources and identifying opportunities for the integration of information systems, platforms, and services across all business units.

With more than 20 years in higher education, he has extensive experience in risk management, data governance, operational change management, and strategic leadership. Before joining Georgia Tech, he held IT leadership roles at the University of Oregon and North Carolina State University.

In his new permanent role, Howell will provide vision, leadership, and oversight in the development and implementation of information technology. He will be responsible for establishing the strategic direction of information technology resources, including a governance strategy, as well as supporting information users by determining trends and technologies needed to advance the Institute’s academic and research mission.

“I am very excited for this opportunity to be in an environment that is committed to being innovative and data-driven,” Howell said. “I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Georgia Tech community to develop an inclusive information technology strategy that will further the Institute’s continued commitment to administrative excellence through collaboration and innovation.”
