# Fraternity/Sorority Membership Fee

The Greek Life Task Force formed in October 2016 comprised of staff, students, and family members, held rich discussions that led to a series of clear recommendations for action and issues for consideration by student leaders in partnership with advisors, alumni, house corporation leaders, and Institute officials. The preliminary report represents initial findings, recommendations, and considerations of the Greek Life Task Force. In particular, the report emphasizes the need for Institute support of high-impact learning practices and greater support of NPHC & MPC organizations. Thus, the Fraternity/Sorority Membership Fee was created.
