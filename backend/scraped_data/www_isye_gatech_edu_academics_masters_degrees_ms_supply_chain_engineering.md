The M.S. in Supply Chain Engineering degree program is offered only at Georgia Tech's Atlanta campus, and is most suitable for full-time students. Full-time students can complete the program in 12 months (Fall-Spring-Summer), while those who wish to pursue a full-time summer internship may take up to 16 months (Fall-Spring-Fall). As a STEM-designated program, international students who complete the degree are eligible for the extended Optional Practical Training (OPT) F-1 visa extension which allows a total of 29 months of pre- and post-completion training.

Program applicants may come from a wide range of academic, business, and geographical backgrounds, but they will share a common motivation: to pursue a highly focused graduate education experience in supply chain engineering. Most graduates immediately head to career opportunities with global enterprises, but the program is also useful preparation for follow-on research study in an engineering or business Ph.D. program focused on supply chain challenges.

## Capstone Industry Experience

The summer (May-July) term\* of the [M.S. in Supply Chain Engineering program](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/masters/supply-chain-engineering) is dedicated to the Capstone Project in which students identify and define a supply chain design and/or analysis problem to be addressed with quantitative modeling. Projects are conducted with sponsors from business, government, or non-government organizations. Students apply their knowledge and skills to the project, and deliver valuable solutions to their sponsoring organizations.

Students can complete the Capstone requirement either as an individual (typically a paid internship) working on an approved project, or within a small group of students (typically 2-4). In either case, each project will be advised by a member of Georgia Tech's supply chain engineering faculty. During the Spring semester, students and faculty work together to identify partners and projects prior to beginning the work. Most students complete their Capstone Project during the summer term while enrolled half time. Others choose to delay the Capstone until the following fall term, and use the summer to instead conduct a full-time internship or to travel.The Capstone project is completed in two phases. A short proposal phase is used to scope the project and define deliverables, which is followed by a work phase. Students report on their projects and results in oral presentations and written reports. Final oral presentations are grouped together on Capstone Project Day, where the whole class gets to hear about all of the interesting work conducted by their cohort classmates.

Students in the program are required to find approved Capstone Projects by early April each year. Once approved by Georgia Tech, the Capstone Project team begins project work in mid-May, and concludes project work by the end of July.

Each student is expected to spend a minimum of 200 productive hours on the project, including time spent preparing a formal work proposal, collecting data and building analytical models, conducting analysis and interpreting results, and preparing a final project report. Students will also deliver proposals and final reports in oral presentations to the faculty and sponsors.

Can I start my Master's degree program in Spring semester?

This is discouraged for new Master's students. In rare cases, some students may begin in Spring but our course sequence is designed for Fall semester entrants. Please contact the [Associate Chair for Graduate Studies](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/user/47/contact) if you are interested in beginning your program in Spring semester.

Do I qualify for admission?

We are not able to make admissions evaluations via email.  Once you complete a formal and complete application, it will be given the consideration it deserves.  The admissions process will examine the applicant’s prior academic performance, including our sense of the rigor of prior degrees and their institutions, GRE scores, personal statement and recommendation letters.

Do you accept the IELTS?

Yes, the IELTS exam is accepted. See here for score requirements: [https://www.grad.gatech.edu/english-proficiency](https://www.grad.gatech.edu/english-proficiency "(opens in a new window)")

Do you accept transfer credit?

Transfer credit is accepted only in rare cases, and must be approved by the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies, ISyE.  A maximum of six credit hours are transferrable.  A transfer credit request should be submitted to the Academic Office in a student's first semester.

Do you offer an online option?

MS in Industrial Engineering as well as MS in Operations Research are offered as Distance Learning (online) degree programs.

See here for more information on our online degrees: [https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees#tab-master-of-science-degrees](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees#tab-master-of-science-degrees "(opens in a new window)")

Does ISyE provide financial support for M.S. students?

Since the graduate program in the Stewart School is exceptionally large, we have adopted a policy regarding financial aid that is perhaps somewhat different than that pursued by other, smaller programs. Generally, ISyE does not offer funding support to Master's applicants, and it is rare that our faculty offer TA/RA support (especially in a student's first semester) to Master's students. Occasionally, a Master's student might be offered a paying position, but this is usually in a student's second or third semester, and students should never send mass emails to faculty soliciting financial support. Should opportunities arise for Master's students, the Academic Office will send a mass email to all students.

Does it make sense to enroll in the M.S. in Supply Chain Engineering program if my ultimate goal is to receive a Ph.D.?

It could be. The M.S. in Supply Chain Engineering is a practice-focused degree and could be good preparation for Ph.D. study in supply chain applications especially for students who do not have much real-world work experience. Quantitative methods for supply chain engineering are covered in depth. However, the primary purpose of the degree is to prepare graduates for industrial practice and not for research.

How do I check the status of my application?

Applicants should track their status through the CollegeNet online status check at: [http://www.gradadmiss.gatech.edu/status-checking](http://www.gradadmiss.gatech.edu/status-checking "(opens in a new window)")

For target class sizes for the interdisclipinary M.S. in Quantitative and Computational Finance and the M.S. in Computational Science and Engineering, please consult the respective program directors.

I work full time in the Atlanta area. Are any of the courses offered at night or on weekends?

Most current courses are offered between 8 am and 6 pm on weekdays. While it is possible to earn an on-campus M.S. degree while working full time, it will require attending courses during the workday. Contact the [Associate Chair for Graduate Studies](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/user/47/contact) for more information.

Is the GRE and TOEFL (if applicable) required at the time of application?

No. You can apply without having available scores, however official test scores must be received prior to officially being granted admission to Georgia Tech.

Is work experience required?

While work experience is not a requirement for admission, it is viewed favorably by the admissions committee when reviewing an application.

May I apply for more than one program?

Technically, yes. However, an applicant can enroll in only one degree program.

My country’s primary language is English, do I still need to provide a TOEFL score?

Exceptions are given to applicants from countries where English is the SOLE OFFICIAL language of instruction.  An applicant is also exempt if they have studied for at least one academic year at a U.S. college or university.  Please visit [http://catalog.gatech.edu/admissions/grad/toefl/p](http://catalog.gatech.edu/admissions/grad/toefl/ "(opens in a new window)") for further information on TOEFL requirements for international students.

My GRE exam date is scheduled after the application deadline. Can I still apply?

Yes, you can still apply. However, we can only guarantee a review (and decision) of an application for those who submit a complete application by the deadline.

What are the differences between the M.S. Supply Chain Engineering program and the M.S. Industrial Engineering program? Can't I find a supply chain position with either degree?

The MSIE degree is earned solely through completing a set of coursework, and only offers a few courses that touch on supply chain applications of industrial engineering and operations research. It is a broader degree. The MSSCE provides depth of coverage in supply chain engineering, with a special limited enrollment set of courses. Many MSSCE courses feature class projects conducted for industry partners. Students also complete a Capstone Project experience with industry. If you want hands-on experience in your degree program, the MSSCE may be a better choice for you.

What are the financial document requirements for international students?

For clarification on what the requirements are for international students who will need an I-20, please review the Preparation & Arrival guide under the OIE website: [https://oie.gatech.edu/content/international-student-scholar-services?qt-isss\_quicktabs=3&qt-isss\_quicktabs\_jscholar=2](https://oie.gatech.edu/isss/home?qt-isss_quicktabs=3&amp%3Bqt-isss_quicktabs_jscholar=2 "(opens in a new window)")
