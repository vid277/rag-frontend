## **Change of Major Rules & Regulations (Institute Level Rules)**

Undergraduate students will be permitted one unrestricted transfer between majors until they have earned 60 credit hours.  There are a few departments who have been granted exceptions to that rule, so please contact an advisor in that department to be sure.  ME and ISYE are both exceptions to the institute policy.  See the ME requirements below.

- After 60 hours or upon subsequent change of major, the change will be permitted at the discretion of the school that the student is seeking to enter.
- Students who transfer from another institution will be permitted to change their major only at the discretion of the school that the student is seeking to enter.
- _Beginning Summer 2017_ \- Admitted freshmen will not be allowed to submit a request for a change of major until after the [deadline for withdrawal from classes with a W grade](http://www.registrar.gatech.edu/calendar/) in the first term of their enrollment. The change would be effective for the second term of enrollment. This includes a change of major within the student's current College. For freshmen admitted for Summer, the restriction is lifted after the withdraw deadline of their second semester of enrollment. All other restrictions also apply.
- Students who wish to add a secondary major must fill out a change of major form and are subject to the same requirements as changing your major, including completing the Canvas Module.

## **Requirements to Change your Major to ME or NRE (Department Rules)**

#### Permits for ME and NRE Classes

Students who do not meet the requirements below or are still in the process of changing their major when registration starts may [request Restricted Class Permits](https://me.gatech.edu/registration-4#overrides) to register for non-lab ME or NRE classes for one semester, while working towards meeting the above requirements.  Permit requests will be reviewed on an individual basis and are usually evaluated after the first week of registration.

#### **ME Specific Requirements**

- A student who started at Georgia Tech as a Freshman and has not yet changed majors can change their major to ME within their first 2 semesters in residence without any restrictions after the withdraw deadline of fall semester (usually late October). The Change of Major form must be received prior to completion of their second semester.  Students that began at Georgia Tech in the _Freshman Summer Session_, the Change of Major form must be received prior to completion of their third semester.  Students in this window have no GPA requirements or required classes to complete.
- All other students (including students who started as transfer students) must meet the following requirements:
  - Completed at least 12 credit hours of coursework for letter grade while in residence at Georgia Tech. The 12 credit hours must be for “in-class” coursework and can not include AP or similar, nor can it include courses satisfied by exam.

The Change of Major form must be received prior to completion of earning 60 credit hours.

## **How to Change your Major or Declare a 2nd Major (Process)**

- Attend a change of major meeting (either in person or through Canvas) with the new major. This needs to be done before the department will sign the form, but does not obligate you to change your major.  Departments with known requirements are:
  - [Business Administration](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/explore-programs/undergraduate/student-services/change-of-major.html)
  - [Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/create-application-changing-majors-computer-science)
  - [Chemical Engineering](http://www.chbe.gatech.edu/change-of-major)
  - [Civil & Environmental Engineering](https://ce.gatech.edu/change-major)
  - [Industrial Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/bachelors/current-students/change-major)
  - [Mechanical Engineering](https://gatech.instructure.com/enroll/HK3J6D) (required Canvas module, about 30 minutes long)
  - Other departments usually have no requirements to change your major.
- Obtain a [change of major form](http://registrar.gatech.edu/info/change-major-form-undergraduate-students_ds) and review the DocuSign instructions. Use this form to change your major, add a second major or remove a second major.  A few pointers are below:

  - **DocuSign Instructions**:

    - For the ME or NRE signature, enter **Kristi Mehaffey**(email is kl127@gatech.edu) no matter who your assigned advisor is.
    - You can find advisors in all departments using [the advising website.](http://advising.gatech.edu/)
    - DocuSign will automatically submit the form to the registrar's office after all departments have signed the form.
  - Form Information:
    - Degree:  BS for all undergraduate students.
    - Major:  List your current or intended major.  Abbreviations are OK. Ex. Mechanical Engineering is ME.
    - School:  For ME and NRE the school is ME.
    - Catalog Year:  If changing into ME or NRE, then the catalog year will be the current year (ex. 2021). If leaving ME or NRE, then the catalog year is the year you started in the major.
  - Admitted Freshmen:  The earliest time the ME department will sign the form for 1st year students admitted as freshmen is 1 week prior to the withdraw deadline in the fall semester.
- Forms submitted during active registration times may take a week or longer to be signed.
- If you submit your form after phase 2 registration closes for the semester, your change of major will go into effect during the following semester.
