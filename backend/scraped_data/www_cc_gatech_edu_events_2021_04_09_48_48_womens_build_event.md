# 48-in 48 Women's Build Event

![48 in 48 Womens Build Event Logo](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/events/48in48-2021-logo_2.jpg)

This incredible three-day, 100% virtual, experience brings women, and those identifying as female, who are experts in digital marketing and technology together where they use their professional skills to help nonprofits. In one weekend, you will improve a nonprofit's digital footprint by building them a new, free WordPress website. This new site will allow the nonprofit to continue to promote their services in their communities as they do good.

We need your help to make these events a success. [Register online to volunteer and join a team that will build a nonprofit website.](https://48in48.org/volunteer-signup/)

There are tons of ways to participate, just check the list below to find your perfect role. Together, we will be serving nonprofits all over the world while showcasing and promoting the skill of women!

You do NOT need to know how to code. Each team will need the five skill sets listed below. You should be familiar with WordPress and Beaver Builder to have the best experience. We also have an extensive knowledge base at learn.48in48.org to get started.
