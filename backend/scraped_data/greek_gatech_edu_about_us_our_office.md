The Fraternity & Sorority Life department includes three professional advisors. The staff are part of a team with other units that make up the [Center for Student Engagement](https://studentengagement.gatech.edu/) which falls under of the [Division of Student Engagement and Well-Being](https://students.gatech.edu/). We work in collaboration with other offices in Student and Academic Life to support the success of our students. Our staff relies on regular communication with the headquarters staff and volunteers that help manage the individual chapters in conjunction with our student leaders and councils.

Our office recently moved to the third floor of the new [John Lewis Student Center](https://studentcenter.gatech.edu/about-phase-ii) which will be open to the public mid-July. We will welcome visitors to our office once the building is open to the public. The office is open year-round except for official Institute holidays; Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

## Core Values

### Holistic Development

Our advising focuses on a holistic perspective which is concerned with the development of every person's intellectual, emotional, social, physical, ethical, cultural, creative, and spiritual potentials

### Values Based

We believe in the values each organization's founders determined were the basis for their brotherhood and sisterhood. We challenge each member to hold themselves and their brothers and sisters to these values each day.

### Collaboration

We believe in the importance of campus and community collaboration and work at establishing strong partnerships with all that have a stake in the success of fraternity and sorority life at Tech.

### Belonging

We approach our work from a fair and impartial standpoint and advocates for the same for every member of our community. We focus on creating spaces for individuals to connect and feel included within the councils.

### Empowerment

We believe the fraternity and sorority experience creates the opportunity for each member to become stronger and more confident in their dealings with everyday life.
