## 62 and Older Students

### Eligibility

Georgia residents at least 62 years of age who have been offered admission to Georgia Tech as a non-degree, undergraduate, or graduate student. You can find more details about these options and how to apply in the Admission Types and Application Requirements section below.

Georgia’s opportunities for 62 and Older students are available in other colleges that are part of [University System of Georgia](https://www.usg.edu/institutions/) or [Technical College System of Georgia](https://www.tcsg.edu/find-a-college/). Admission guidelines and policies are determined by each institution.

### Tuition and Fees

62 and Older students who are offered admission receive a waiver of in-state tuition. Students are responsible for books, supplies, and any laboratory fees. Students may also pay voluntary fees that allow them to have access to campus services and activities supported by these fees: Campus Recreation Center (CRC), Health Services, and Athletics.

### What are your educational goals?

Georgia Tech offers courses that allow a student to pursue:

**Non-degree enrollment.** For students who want to take courses for personal or professional development. These students are not working toward a degree.

**Undergraduate degree.** For students who want to pursue a Bachelor of Science degree.

**Graduate degree.** For students who want to pursue a Master’s or Doctoral degree.

### Courses and programs offered at Georgia Tech

#### Undergraduate Non-Degree Programs

**Special Student - Post Baccalaureate**

If you have completed a bachelor’s or baccalaureate degree from another institution, you may apply to study undergraduate courses at Georgia Tech for personal or professional growth, not in pursuit of a degree.

**Transient Student**

If you are currently enrolled as an undergraduate in a college or university and plan to return to your home institution after one semester at Georgia Tech, you may apply for a semester of enrollment at Georgia Tech.

#### Undergraduate Degree Programs

**First-Year Applicant**

If you have never done any college work and would like to pursue a Bachelor of Science Degree, you may apply as a first-year undergraduate student. We do not recommend this application for any student who has been away from high school for more than two years. Because of the competitive first-year applicant pool, we recommend that degree-seeking applicants who have been away from high school for two years plan to transfer to Georgia Tech after completing required introductory course work.

**Transfer Applicant**

If you are currently enrolled in a college program or have been enrolled in the past ten years and would like to transfer to Georgia Tech to finish your undergraduate degree, you may apply for transfer admission. Transfer admission to Georgia Tech is a selective, competitive process. Each major at Georgia Tech has specific course requirements for admission.

**Graduate Programs**

If you would like to take graduate-level classes (those numbered 6000 and above) at Georgia Tech, whether you want to complete a graduate degree or be a non-degree student, you must apply through the Office of Graduate Studies.

**Readmission for Former Georgia Tech Students**

If you were previously enrolled as an undergraduate student at Georgia Tech and have been out of school for two or more consecutive terms, you must apply for readmission. The Readmission process is for Georgia Tech graduates and former students. If you were previously enrolled at Georgia Tech in graduate courses only and wish to take undergraduate courses as a non-degree student now, you may apply as a Special Student through Undergraduate Non-Degree Admission.
