## Please use a random password/password manager for your login on this site

I have no idea what I'm doing and will probably accidentally dump the database somewhere I shouldn't, which would leak email/password logins.

But hey, I probably won't be the first website to do that! Check [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see which other websites have already leaked your passwords.

TLDR; pls don't re-use passwords; especially don't use important ones here
