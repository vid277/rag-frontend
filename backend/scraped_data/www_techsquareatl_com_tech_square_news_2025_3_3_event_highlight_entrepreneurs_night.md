ATDC’s [Entrepreneur’s Night](https://atdc.org/entrepreneurs-night/) has become a cornerstone for Atlanta’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, offering young startups a chance to connect, learn, and grow. Launched in response to a strong demand for more networking opportunities, this monthly event provides a platform for startups to engage with fellow entrepreneurs, industry professionals, and established innovators.

Every third Thursday of the month, the ATDC Community Room transforms into a vibrant networking hub where entrepreneurs can mingle, share ideas, and hear success stories from distinguished speakers. The event is designed not only for learning but also for fostering a sense of community among Atlanta’s diverse startup scene.

Entrepreneur’s Night offers much more than networking. Attendees can learn firsthand how [ATDC’s resources](https://atdc.org/)—such as reasonably priced office space, peer learning events, and a strong sense of community—have contributed to the success of local startups.

In addition to providing valuable networking opportunities and insights, Entrepreneur’s Night occasionally features special events and sponsorships. Oracle sponsored the previous event, and in the past, major corporations like Visa and Home Depot have hosted large-scale events through Entrepreneur’s Night. These sponsored events bring an exciting dynamic to the series, offering startups additional exposure and opportunities to interact with industry giants.

Entrepreneur’s Night occurs every third Thursday of the month from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Entrepreneur's Night is essential to Atlanta's thriving startup ecosystem if you want to expand your network, gain valuable insights, or participate in special sponsored events.
