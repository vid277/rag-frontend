# Why college?

By now, you’ve probably heard the same question over and over:

Where are you going to college?

Before you settle on the “where,” there are a few questions to answer first.

Why do YOU want to go to college?

Is there a job you want to have?

Is there a skill you want to learn?

Is there an area of the country or the world you want to experience?

Think about what your life looks like now. What do you want to keep, and how would you like for it to change?

The mind map below is one example of how to think through your reasons.

Take a look back at your WHY….

Part of your WHY is also your WHAT.

What do you want to do after college?

# What else?

Do you want to stay in your town … your state … or your region (Southeast, Midwest, West Coast, etc.)?

Will you be energized by a big city?

Are you looking for a quieter campus life?

# Make a list.

It’s good to have a list of 7-10 potential university options.

Take a look at the schools you do have, and think about what you like about each of those places. Can you think of other schools that have similar qualities?

The schools that match your listed criteria are a good place to start your college search.

These stats are commonly found in a college’s Freshman Profile or Common Data Set.

# Check the cost.

![](https://admission.gatech.edu/tmp/67bb65ba-3a46-4644-bd35-5aa8d77e41a6/images/d006ad3bd4fbbb4537ddd1428e13d8ae41d963afeb710bad5871f579f1921cb1.jpg)

# Costs include:

• Tuition.

• Housing.

• Meals.

• Books and Supplies.

• Personal Items.

# When you calculate this number, don’t let it scare you!

College is an investment you’re making in yourself. And at many schools, you’ll pay less than the “sticker price” listed online. Look out for Net Price Calculators, which can be found on most schools’ admission and/or financial aid websites.

There are a lot of creative ways to pay your way through college.

Work Study – on-campus jobs where your pay applies directly to your bill. Scholarships – often offered by the prospective college, but be sure to talk to your high school counselor and search online to find outside scholarships offered by local businesses and community organizations.

Grants – similar to scholarships, this is money you don’t have to pay back. Loans – offered to both students and parents, these help you delay making payments until after you graduate.

# Check out additional financial aid resources:

Federal Student Aid Information studentaid.ed.gov

Budget Calculator mappingyourfuture.org/money/budgetcalculator.cfm

# Research

Check the financial aid websites of your colleges to learn more about costs.
