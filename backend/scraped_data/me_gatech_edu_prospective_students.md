## Mechanical Engineering

The Woodruff School graduates high caliber mechanical engineers for a demanding profession.  Mechanical engineers are the foundation of today’s technological world.  To do so, we provide enhanced facilities and laboratories to create the best learning environment and we attract outstanding faculty and students. In this period of rapid technological change, the Woodruff School produces mechanical engineers who are vital to our future.

With approximately 3,000 students,100 faculty members, and 70 staff members, we are one of the largest mechanical engineering programs in the country. We are consistently ranked as one of the top 10 mechanical engineering programs in the U.S. at both the graduate and undergraduate levels and continuously innovate to keep our school at the forefront of engineering education. Our size and resources allow us to offer a diversity of educational and research opportunities that enable us to produce highly sought after engineering professionals.

![World Class Research Facilities](https://me.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/researchAreaPhotos.jpg)

At the graduate level, we perform research in areas such as Mechanics, Robotics and Automation, Thermal Sciences, Energy Systems, Bioengineering, Fluid Mechanics, Nuclear and Medical Physics, Acoustics, Tribology, Design, and Manufacturing, providing for a rich set of research opportunities in world class facilities at Georgia Tech.

## Nuclear and Radiological Engineering

The Woodruff School graduates high caliber nuclear and radiological engineers for a demanding profession. Nuclear and radiological engineers are concerned with the production and application of nuclear energy, the protection from radiation and the applications of radiation in medicine and industry. To do so, we provide enhanced facilities and laboratories to create the best learning environment and we attract outstanding faculty and students.
