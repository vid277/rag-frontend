## Transfer Decision Outcomes

Students who apply for transfer admission will receive one of the following admission decisions. Georgia Tech reserves the right to request additional grades and/or delay decision notification.

### Transfer Pathway Programs

Admission decisions will be released in April after review of mid-term grades for students applying as part of the Conditional Transfer Pathway Program for the Summer 2025 term.

Some students may have their application decision delayed until Georgia Tech receives a final grade report of spring semester grades to verify Conditional Pathway Program requirements.

Admission decisions will be in mid-June after review of final grades for students applying as part of a Fall 2025 transfer pathway program (Arts and Sciences Pathway, First Generation Pathway, Talent Initiative Pathway, Veteran’s Pathway, or Atlanta Public Schools Pathway).

### Admit

Admitted transfers have until the deposit deadline to submit their enrollment deposit of $250 and choose whether to attend Georgia Tech.

### Waitlist

A limited number of students will be offered a place on Georgia Tech’s waitlist. Students on the waitlist are those for whom we would like to offer admission but do not have space available. Though we offer admission to more students than we need for our class size, we can’t be assured whether or not they will accept our offer of admission. The waitlist provides a group of strong students who could fill any remaining spots in the transfer class.

### Deny

Transfer applicants who receive this decision are not offered admission to Georgia Tech.
