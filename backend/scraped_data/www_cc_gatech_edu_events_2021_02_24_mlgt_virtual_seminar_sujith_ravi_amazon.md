##### **Title:** Building the Next-Generation AI: Small and Efficient Neural Computing

##### **Abstract:**

Deep learning has changed the computing paradigm. Today, AI researchers & practitioners increasingly use deep neural networks for many applications across different modalities and areas such as NLP, Vision, Speech, Conversational and Multimodal AI. However, much of the Deep Learning revolution has been limited to the Cloud and highly specialized hardware. Recently the AI community has witnessed an increasing trend for training larger and larger neural models (e.g., GPT-3, T5, BERT) that achieve state-of-the-art results but require enormous computation, memory and energy resources on the Cloud. In order to enable AI experiences in real-time across all users and devices, ML models have to run efficiently on the Cloud and personal devices on the Edge (e.g., mobile phones, wearables, IoT) which have limited computing capabilities.

In this talk, I will introduce our work on Neural Projection computing, an efficient AI paradigm, and a family of efficient Projection Neural Network architectures that yield fast (e.g., quadratic speedup for transformer networks) and tiny models that shrink memory requirements by upto 10000x while achieving near state-of-the-art performance powering vision and NLP applications on billions of mobile devices. Widespread increase in availability of connected “smart” appliances (e.g., conversational assistants) means that there is an ever-expanding surface area for mobile intelligence and ambient devices in homes. Our approach enables efficient ML to solve complex prediction tasks for such applications both on-device and on Cloud, keeping model size, compute and power usage low while simultaneously optimizing for accuracy.

##### **Bio:**

Dr. Sujith Ravi is a Director at Amazon Alexa AI where he is leading efforts to build the future of multimodal conversational AI experiences at scale. Prior to that, he was leading and managing multiple ML and NLP teams and efforts in Google AI. He founded and headed Google’s large-scale graph-based semi-supervised learning platform, deep learning platform for structured and unstructured data as well as on-device machine learning efforts for products used by billions of people in Search, Ads, Assistant, Gmail, Photos, Android, Cloud and YouTube. These technologies power conversational AI (e.g., Smart Reply), Web and Image Search; On-Device predictions in Android and Assistant; and ML platforms like Neural Structured Learning in TensorFlow, Learn2Compress as Google Cloud service, TensorFlow Lite for edge devices.

Dr. Ravi has authored over 100 scientific publications and patents in top-tier machine learning and natural language processing conferences. His work has been featured in press: Wired, Forbes, Forrester, New York Times, TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Engadget, New Scientist, among others, and also won the SIGDIAL Best Paper Award in 2019 and ACM SIGKDD Best Research Paper Award in 2014. For multiple years, he was a mentor for Google Launchpad startups. Dr. Ravi was the Co-Chair (AI and deep learning) for the 2019 National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Frontiers of Engineering symposium. He was also the Co-Chair for EMNLP 2020, ICML 2019, NAACL 2019, and NeurIPS 2018 ML workshops and regularly serves as Senior/Area Chair and PC of top-tier machine learning and natural language processing conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, NAACL, AAAI, EMNLP, COLING, KDD, and WSDM.
