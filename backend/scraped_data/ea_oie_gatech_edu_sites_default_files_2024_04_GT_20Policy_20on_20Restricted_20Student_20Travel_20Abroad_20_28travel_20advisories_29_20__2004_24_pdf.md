# Georgia Institute of Technology Policy on Restricted GT Student Travel Abroad as part of Educational/Experiential Programs

Georgia Institute of Technology monitors information relevant to the safety and security of Georgia Tech students abroad. In evaluating the risks associated with student travel abroad, Georgia Tech gives primary consideration to Travel Advisories issued by the U.S. Department of State (US DoS) and Health Notices issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Students are not permitted to travel abroad as part of an educational/experiential activity in a country with an overall US DoS Travel Advisory Level 3 ( Reconsider Travel ) or Level 4 ( Do Not Travel ) and/or a CDC Health Notice Level 3 ( Avoid Nonessential Travel ) or Level 4 ( Do Not Travel ). Students are permitted to travel abroad as part of an educational/experiential activity to countries with an overall US DoS Travel Advisory Level 1 ( Exercise Normal Precautions) or Level 2 ( Exercise Increased Caution ) and/or CDC Health Notice at Level 1 ( Practice Usual Precautions ) or Level 2 ( Practice Enhanced Precautions ).

Note: Certain areas within any country with an overall Travel Advisory Level 1 or Level 2, may be designated within the Travel Advisory as either Level 3 ( Reconsider Travel ) or Level 4 ( Do Not Travel )locations. As such, students will not be allowed to travel to or reside in these specific areas as part of an educational/experiential activity.

A complete list of U.S. State Department Travel Advisories is published on their official web site: [http://travel.state.gov](http://travel.state.gov/) .

To review Travel Health Notices highlighted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: [https://www.cdc.gov/](https://www.cdc.gov/)

This policy applies to students who are participating in an overseas activity affiliated with Georgia Tech while matriculated at the Institute. This includes, but is not limited to, international internships, facultyled study abroad, exchange programs, research abroad, embedded study abroad courses, international academic projects, international conferences, service trips abroad, alternative service breaks abroad, registered student org trips abroad, CRC international activities, ORGT groups traveling abroad, etc.

Proposals will not be approved, and agreements will not be signed for programs or activities in countries or areas of countries with Level 3 or Level 4 Travel Advisories/Health Notices.

Should the Travel Advisory or Health Notice rating change to a Level 3 or Level 4 after an activity or program abroad is planned, approved, or is in progress, the GT Emergency Response Plan for Programs Abroad will be activated for decision-making.

The Institute’s Appeal Committee on Restricted Student Travel Abroad will consider appeals of this policy for student travel as part of an educational/experiential activity to countries, or areas within countries, with a Level 3 Travel Advisory or Level 3 Health Notice. Appeals for student travel to locations with an active Level 4 Travel Advisory or Level 4 Health Notice will not be accepted nor approved.
