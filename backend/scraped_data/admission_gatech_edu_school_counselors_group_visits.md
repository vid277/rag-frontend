## Group Campus Visits

Georgia Tech group visits consist of a 30-minute admission information session and campus tour (guided or [self-guided](https://application.gatech.edu/register/selfguidedtour)). Information sessions are offered Tuesdays through Tuesdays at 9am or 12pm.

Our office is also offering [virtual programming](https://admission.gatech.edu/virtual-visit). Through these programs, students and families will have opportunities to engage with admission staff, current Tech students, and the greater Tech Community.

### Group Visit Criteria

To be considered for a group visit, you must fit the following criteria:

- High school students grades 9 through 12 or college students interested in transfer. **Unfortunately, we are unable to accommodate elementary and middle school groups.**

- **Groups must be visiting from a high school, higher education institution, or directly affiliated with high school program.** This includes community-based organizations with a college readiness program.

- Group visits must be arranged for any group larger than 10 students. Groups should be no larger than 50 people (including chaperones). If your group is larger than 50, please contact our [group visit coordinator](mailto:admission@gatech.edu).

- There should be one chaperone per 20 visiting students.


### Registration Information

- Reservations are required and must be completed online at least 3 weeks in advance.

- Once you have completed the online inquiry form, it will be reviewed by our group visit coordinator. You will receive an email within five (5) business days of submitting your request.

- If your group is approved to visit campus, please familiarize yourself with the Group Expectations Contract. This contract contains all our expectations for group visits. We reserve the right to deny future visit requests from groups that do not abide by our policies.

- All reservations requests should be submitted by the school group. If you choose to use a tour company to schedule your visit, they must provide the name and phone number of a chaperone who will be attending with the group.


### Important Reminders

- If interested in viewing a residence hall, visit our [housing website](https://housing.gatech.edu/) to access a 3D floor plan and 360 degree tour for each of our housing options.

- You may have lunch on campus. Please visit our [Dining Services website](https://dining.gatech.edu/home) to view the dining options, hours of operation, and their contact information.

- Parking on campus is limited. If you plan to bring a bus to campus, you will need to reserve a bus parking spot by completing the [Special Event Parking Request form](https://www.pts.gatech.edu/forms/special-event-parking-request/) through Parking & Transportation Services. Select the option 'Visitors Bus Parking' as the preferred parking area.


  - The bus parking request should be completed **two weeks** prior to your visit to confirm availability on campus and get an account set up for your group/school in the Parking system. There is a fee of approximately $30/bus associated with the reservation, which will need to be prepaid prior to the visit.

  - Any questions regarding bus parking should be directed to 404-894-0061. Be sure to reference your submission number on the call.


- Atlanta weather is oftentimes unpredictable. Please wear comfortable shoes and bring an umbrella and water bottle with you to campus.

- If your group arrives more than 15 minutes late, we will provide the group with information to begin the self-guided tour as time constraints may not allow for an information session.


If we are unable to accommodate your group for any reason, we hope that you still consider visiting Georgia Tech! Our virtual visits page contains a [self-guided tour](https://application.gatech.edu/register/selfguidedtour) that will help you lead your group on a campus tour.

All questions regarding group visits may be directed to our group visit coordinator Ja’Kira Jackson at [admission@gatech.edu](mailto:admission@gatech.edu).
