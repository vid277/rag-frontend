#1 Industrial and Systems Engineering Program

at the undergraduate and graduate levels

Established originally as a program in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech in 1924, ISyE became a School in 1945. This school is considered the largest Industrial Engineering program in the country; the second largest is not even half our size. ISyE was named in honor of H. Milton Stewart, who has a long history of philanthropy at Georgia Tech. H. Milton Stewart, Jr., IE 1961, and Carolyn J. Stewart, Honorary Alumna 2008, established the H. Milton Stewart Endowment Fund for ISyE programs in 1995 and the H. Milton and Carolyn J. Stewart School Chair in ISyE in 1999.
