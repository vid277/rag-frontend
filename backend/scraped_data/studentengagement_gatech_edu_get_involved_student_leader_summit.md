### **Are you an aspiring leader or current campus leader?** Join us for the Student Leadership Summit to network with your fellow leaders, connect with powerful resources, and engage in leadership development! During the Summit you'll engage in various sessions hosted by institute leaders, developed to make YOU a better leader.

Originally, the Leadership Summit was started as the President's Summit, a program hosted by the President's Council Governing Board (PCGB). PCGB (an RSO from 2006-2018) created the Leader Summit to help fulfill their organizational mission to "promote communication among student organizations, education of students, diversity and interaction within the campus, and collaboration among organizations." In the 10+ years since the creation of the Leadership Summit, the event has continued to bring together students from across Georgia Tech to provide resources, venues for discussion, and collaboration among our 600+ student organizations.

The [2024 Student Leadership Summit](https://gatech.campuslabs.com/engage/event/10156531) is **October 27, 2024**, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Exhibition Hall.As a participant of this event, you will receive exclusive swag.

### What?

The Student Leadership Summit is a leadership development and training conference hosted by the Center for Student Engagement. Each fall, this event brings together Tech's returning and new leaders for a day of collaboration, training, information, and preparation with a collective goal in mind: preparing our organization leaders to make meaningful change in their student organizations.

### Who?

All students are invited to attend the Student Leadership Summit. Even if you don't think of yourself as a leader, if you've never held an elected position on campus or if you've been the president of an org -- Leadership Summit is for you. To support our Registered Student Organizations (RSOs), we encourage each RSO to send at least two representatives: a current officer and an emerging leader (a junior office or a member the organization is encouraging to run for future officer roles).
