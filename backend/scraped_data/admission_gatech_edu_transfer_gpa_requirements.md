## Grade Point Average Requirements

The minimum GPA requirement is 3.3 on a 4.0 grade scale for College of Computing and College of Engineering applicants. The minimum GPA requirement is 3.0 on a 4.0 grade scale for College of Design, College of Sciences, Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and Scheller College of Business applicants. The
average GPA for our 2024 class was a 3.7.

Students applying through the Arts and Sciences Pathway, Conditional Pathway, First Generation Pathway, Talent Initiative Pathway, or Atlanta Public Schools Pathway are required to earn a cumulative 3.5 GPA (or higher) and B grades (or higher) in all college coursework.

An overall or cumulative GPA review includes coursework taken at all previous institutions (domestic and international). The overall GPA we consider is taken directly from your official college transcripts and/or foreign credit evaluation report.

### How We Evaluate GPA

We calculate a math and lab science GPA for most applications and use the grading scale below. Math GPA reviews include calculus level and higher math. Lab Science GPA reviews include Biology, Chemistry, Calculus-Based Physics, Environmental Science, and EAS (Earth and Atmospheric Sciences) courses with a lab component.

- A+, A, A- grades = 4 quality points each X number of course credit hours

- B+, B, B- grades = 3 quality points each X number of course credit hours

- C+, C, C- grades = 2 quality points each X number of course credit hours

- Course grades below a C- do not receive quality points.


Math and Lab Science GPA = total number of M/LS quality points divided by total number of M/LS course credit hours

### Other Important Information

- Computer Science and Engineering courses are not considered a lab science course and will not be included within math and lab science GPA calculations.

- Lab science courses must include lecture and lab components and total at least four semester or six quarter credit hours.

- Repeat coursework is not included within GPA calculations unless a student did not receive a passing grade on the first attempt.

- An F and D is considered failing and is included in the GPA calculation, even if the grading scale is considered Pass/Fail (P/F).
