# AI-Powered Innovation for Safer Roads

Mar 19

Written By 
Artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be everywhere, entering and revolutionizing various industries. Professor [James Tsai](https://ce.gatech.edu/directory/person/yi-chang-james-tsai) from Georgia Tech’s [School of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://ce.gatech.edu/) is leveraging AI to tackle one of the most pressing transportation challenges—roadway safety. His startup, [Safe Road Solutions](https://create-x.gatech.edu/node/3129), is implementing an innovative, AI-powered approach to identifying and mitigating dangerous road conditions, focusing on hazardous curves.

Despite comprising only 5% of US roadway miles, curves account for 25% of all traffic-related fatalities. Assessing these hazardous areas has traditionally been a manual, labor-intensive, and costly process, often taking years to complete the road network for counties, cities, and states. This delay means essential safety improvements—such as proper curve warning signage and speed adjustments—are not implemented in time to prevent crashes.

**AI-Driven Roadway Safety with Smartphones**

Safe Road Solutions is transforming how roadway safety assessments are conducted. Instead of relying on expensive dedicated hardware, the company utilizes standard smartphones mounted in agencies’ vehicles.

### The system works by:

·         Capturing video, GPS, and motion data via the phone’s onboard sensors.

·         Using AI algorithms to analyze road curvature, existing signage, and potential risks.

·         Flagging areas that require safety improvements for human engineers to review.

The low-cost and automated approach enables agency workers to gather real-time data by placing phones in their vehicles without disrupting daily tasks.  This automation also allows agencies to take more proactive action before accidents occur rather than reacting after tragedies strike. “This isn’t just about improving data collection for these agencies; it’s about saving lives,” Tsai remarks.

**The Future of Road Safety**

Professor Tsai envisions a future where AI-driven road safety assessments become the norm, helping transportation agencies worldwide improve safety with incredible speed, accuracy, and affordability. His team is also exploring the integration of edge computing and crowdsourced data collection to make the system even more efficient. “We’re developing real-time driver alerts that could integrate with navigation apps like Google Maps, allowing drivers to choose routes based on safety rather than just speed.

"Our work saves lives and positively impacts our community and society," says Tsai. "By making safety assessments more accessible and efficient, we can prevent crashes before they happen."

Safe Road Solutions has already significantly impacted Georgia. While at Georgia Tech, they partnered with the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) to assess over 18,000 miles of state roads. This work was featured in GDOT’s [Fall 2023 MilePost Magazine](https://www.flipsnack.com/GADOT/georgia-milepost-fall-2023.html) in an article titled “Curves Ahead— _Artificial Intelligence Improves Safety.”_

The company is now aiming to expand its reach. “We hope to collaborate with other state Departments of Transportation like Alabama and Arizona,” Tsai remarks. “We are also acquiring international patents in places like the European Union, Canada, and Japan.”

According to the United Nations, one person dies in a road accident every 24 seconds, which is around 1.35 million people per year. In addition to deaths, road traffic accidents incur billions of dollars in associated costs, which can amount to as much as 3% of GDP in some countries. Safe Road Solutions has the potential to reduce these numbers significantly.

“Safe Road Solutions is redefining roadway safety assessment, providing transportation agencies a faster, more efficient way to identify and address hazardous areas. By leveraging AI and automation, the company is helping make roads safer and prevent accidents before they occur,” Tsai concludes.
