## First-Year Admission Deadlines

First-year students will apply to Georgia Tech using the [Common Application](https://www.commonapp.org/). You may start an application at any time during your high school career, and we will begin accepting application submissions on August 1 of your senior year.

We admit students for both the Summer and Fall Academic Terms, and **ALL applicants** will be considered for both terms.

**In response to the impact from the California wildfires, Georgia Tech will provide a deadline extension for Summer Semester applicants located in impacted areas. [Visit this page](https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/emergency-deadline-extension) to view additional information.**

| Application Plan | 2025 Application Deadline | Document Deadline | Self-Reported Test Score Deadline | Decision Release |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Early Action 1**<br>_Georgia Students Only_ | October 15 | October 31 | November 18 | December 6 |
| **Early Action 2**<br>_Non-Georgia Students Only_ | November 1 | November 18 | January 6 | January 31 |
| **Regular Decision** | January 6 | January 21\* | January 21 | March 7 - Georgia students<br>March 28 - non-Georgia students |

\*The document deadline is for school reports, transcripts, recommendations and any other required school information. Test scores may be self-reported through the date posted for your application round.

_Please note:_ All deadlines are 11:59 p.m. in your time zone (for example, a student who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, must submit their application by 11:59 p.m. ET).

Students with incomplete Early Action files may complete their application and be considered for admission in Regular Decision. Students who do not complete their file by the document and self-reported test score deadline for Regular Decision will have their application closed.

## Early Action Deadlines

An Early Action application to Georgia Tech is non-binding, and the application and evaluation is the same as for Regular Decision.

- **Early Action 1** – This application deadline is reserved for Georgia students, defined by those who attend a Georgia high school or Georgia residents living outside the state.
- **Early Action 2** – This application deadline is reserved for non-Georgia students who wish to be evaluated in an early action round, defined by those who attend a high school outside Georgia (including international) and are not Georgia residents.

Students who wish to be considered for academic scholarships, such as the [Stamps President's Scholars Program](https://scholars.em.gatech.edu/), [Scheller Dean's Scholarship](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/degree-programs/undergraduate/scholarships-awards/scholarship-for-incoming-freshmen/index.html) and others, must apply by the appropriate Early Action deadline (depending on Georgia status). No separate scholarship application is required.

## Regular Decision Deadline

This is the last date to apply for first-year admission for the following summer/fall term. The application and evaluation is the same as for Early Action. Decisions for **REGULAR DECISION** will be released in two rounds as outlined above in the Application Plan table.

## Document Deadlines

All application files will include:

- Common Application.
- Official transcript(s) with 9-12th courses and 9-11th grades. Students who are deferred or apply Regular Decision are required to submit an updated transcript with Fall term senior grades.
- Self-reported or official SAT/ACT scores.
- Additional documents requested via your [admission portal](http://application.gatech.edu/apply/status).

### Transcripts

Transcripts must be submitted electronically or postmarked no later than the date listed in the table above for the round you have applied. Students who have taken dual enrollment courses should ensure those courses are listed on their high school transcript or request the college attended to send your transcript to us directly. Students who are admitted and enroll will be required to submit an official transcript directly from the college to be considered for any transfer credit.

### Test Scores

We strongly suggest you self-report SAT/ACT scores on your application or via your applicant portal. They may also be submitted officially from the testing agency. We do not recommend paying the expedited rush fee to meet the test score deadline since you can self-report scores through your admission portal. [Click here](https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/standardized-tests) for more information on test scores.

### Other Documentation

Additional documents may be requested upon review of your file. These documents will be due by the document deadline for that round or as soon as possible if requested after the deadline.
