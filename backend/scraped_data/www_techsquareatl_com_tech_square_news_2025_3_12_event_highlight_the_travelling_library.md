Every second Wednesday of the month, the lobby of the [TSRB building](https://www.tsrb.gatech.edu/) in Tech Square transforms into a haven for book lovers and curious minds alike. The Traveling Library, a monthly community event hosted by TSQ ATL and led by Vicky Fowler, invites visitors to browse an ever-changing selection of books spanning genres and disciplines. Whether donating, checking out a book, or simply pausing for a coffee and donut, attendees find themselves immersed in a space that fosters discovery and connection.

“The Traveling Library isn’t just about books—it’s about people,” says Fowler. “Many folks in TSRB don’t even know their neighbors, which gives them a reason to stop, chat, and realize the depth of talent and ideas around them.” Each month, the library features a thematic selection, such as Black Authors in February for Black History Month or Women Authors in March for Women’s History Month. This ensures a fresh and thought-provoking experience with every visit.

Beyond the casual exchange of literature, the event also serves as a showcase for the expertise housed within Tech Square. Professors contribute their own published works—like [Dr. John Cressler’s](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/john-d-cressler) [_Anthems of al-Andalus_](https://johndcressler.com/) series—adding a local touch to the diverse collection. In a building where disciplines range widely, the Traveling Library is more than just a book swap; it’s a catalyst for conversation and community.
