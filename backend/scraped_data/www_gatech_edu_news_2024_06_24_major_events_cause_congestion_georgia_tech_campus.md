# Major Events to Cause Congestion on Georgia Tech Campus

Jun 24, 2024


Georgia Tech will experience increased police presence and traffic disruptions this week, beginning Tuesday, June 25, as a result of several events happening on and near campus.

CNN is hosting a presidential debate on Thursday, June 27, at the Warner Media campus on Techwood Drive. Two road closures will tentatively take effect late Wednesday and continue through Thursday until midnight: 10th Street from State Street to Spring Street, and Fowler Street from Sixth to 10th Street. Vehicular traffic will be diverted from the intersection of 10th and State to 14th Street. Pedestrians can pass through from the west side of 10th Street up to Holly Street. Additionally, rolling roadblocks will affect traffic flow on I-75/85 Thursday evening.

Due to the road closures, the Green and Emory routes of the Stinger bus system will be detoured Thursday. Expect delays on all bus routes and Stingerette services, specifically service to and from the Graduate Living Center. For up-to-date transit alerts, visit the [Stinger Website](https://www.pts.gatech.edu/shuttles/stinger/) or [Stingerette Website](https://www.pts.gatech.edu/shuttles/stingerette/) or download the [Transloc](https://transloc.com/app/) app. The time and location of the road closures are subject to change. **The following Green Route Stops will not be serviced on Thursday, June 27.**

- 14th Street and State Street.
- GTRI Conference Center.
- 10th and Fowler Sreet.
- Graduate Living Center.

Georgia Tech’s McCamish Pavilion will serve as the primary base for national and local media for the event. Closure notices have been issued to permit holders in the McCamish parking lot (E65) and along Fowler Street (E55). Vehicles parked in the 10th and Home parking deck (E66) will also be affected, and Parking and Transportation Services will contact affected permit holders with additional information.

Additionally, the Campus Recreation Center (CRC) will host the Atlanta Swim Association Swim Meet June 26 – 28 at the McAuley Aquatic Center. The CRC Parking Deck (W10) will be closed to permit holders. Expect extra vehicular traffic in the area and increased foot traffic in the CRC.

For adjusted recreational swimming hours, visit the [aquatics hours webpage](https://t.e2ma.net/click/snr6evb/c7fyud5j/sf1co2j).

Just south of campus, Mercedes-Benz Stadium will host the [CONMEBOL Copa América USA 2024](https://www.mercedesbenzstadium.com/events/conmebol-copa-america-2), with a match between the U.S. and Panama on Thursday, June 27. Kickoff is set for 6 p.m.

FASET sessions will be held throughout the week. Anticipate additional traffic around the John Lewis Student Center.

For those who are able, employees are [reminded](https://hr.gatech.edu/2024/05/30/summer-work-schedule-flexibility-reminders/) to consider using [summer work flexibility](https://hr.gatech.edu/2024/05/30/summer-work-schedule-flexibility-reminders/) as a solution to campus traffic during these events.
