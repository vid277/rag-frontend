### Welcome to the RSO Advisor Resource Guide!

Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) at Georgia Tech actively participate in and contribute to a vibrant institute community. The more than Tech's 600 RSOs provide transformative experiences and opportunities for students to grow as individuals, leaders, and community members.

The programs, social and cultural events, service projects, and many other activities organized by student groups contribute to making the student experience the best that it can be.

This resource guide outlines the expectations and resources for RSO Advisors at Georgia Tech as well as assists RSOs with their operations. It is created by the professional staff in the Center for Student Engagement and revisited every year prior to the start of the academic year and may change from academic year to academic year.

As such, this version of the resource guide should only be referenced within the academic year indicated (2022-2023). It is by no means exhaustive, but it is a great place to start if you are new to advising student organizations. In it, you will find helpful information regarding the organization and operation of RSOs and policies that impact their work.

Any updates to policies, procedures, guidelines, or regulations to RSO activities (e.g. meetings, events, programs, recruitment, tabling, elections, etc.) provided by Georgia Tech, the University System of Georgia, or the State of Georgia take precedence over any previously documented policies, including those outlined in this resource guide.

Serving as an advisor to an RSO is an important role. Advisors provide the guidance necessary to help any group succeed in its endeavors. The Center for Student Engagement is available to assist you in any way possible, and we appreciate your willingness to take on the role of advisor.
