## Atlanta Bridge Program

The Atlanta Bridge Program, a partnership between Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) and Atlanta Metropolitan State College (AMSC), provides a cohort-based transfer opportunity for academically talented students to earn a Georgia Tech degree.

## Program Details

A cohort of 40-50 students will be selected to participate in the Atlanta Bridge Program. Students begin their studies at AMSC in the Fall 2025 semester and will complete the [required coursework to transfer](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major) to Georgia Tech within four (4) academic semesters. After successful completion of coursework, including a Georgia Tech seminar course, students will transfer to Georgia Tech to complete their four-year degree.

During their time at AMSC, students will receive academic advising and support from both institutions. Co-curricular programming, including networking, mentoring, and cohort building activities will be provided on each college campus to enhance individual and group success.

## Program Eligibility

Students will be selected based both on proven academic success in high school and potential for completing a Georgia Tech degree.

1. Complete the [required high school curriculum](https://www.usg.edu/student_affairs/assets/student_affairs/documents/Staying_on_Course.pdf) of the University System of Georgia. (4 English, 4 Math, 4 Science, 3 Social Science, 2 Foreign Language/CS/ASL)
