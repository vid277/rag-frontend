## Transfer Application Requirements

The transfer application process is a selective, competitive process. Georgia Tech uses a [holistic review](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/application-review) process to select students who will benefit from the campus learning environment and enrich the entire student body. Please review the following application requirements:

### Eligibility

An eligible transfer applicant must be a high school graduate before the [application available period](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/deadlines-fees) of their application term. For example, a student applying for fall term must be a high school graduate before the fall application opens Jan. 15 to be eligible to apply for transfer admission.

### Transfer Credit Hours

A transfer applicant is a degree-seeking student who has completed a minimum of 30 semester or 45 quarter credit hours. This includes students who have earned college credit through dual enrollment or credit by exam (AP or IB).

Students applying as part of a [transfer pathway program](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/transfer-pathway-programs) are required to complete 30 semester or 45 quarter credit hours after high school graduation. College credit earned through dual enrollment or credit by exam (AP/IB) does not count towards the 30 semester or 45 quarter credit hour requirement after high school graduation.

### Course Requirements by Major

Review our Course Requirements by Major Chart to identify the minimum course requirements for your intended major. Transfer applicants must complete the course requirements for their intended major by the [course requirement deadline](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/deadlines-fees). Students applying as part of Dual Degree Engineering or Regents Engineering Pathway Programs have a separate and different course requirements chart.

### Official Transcripts

An official transcript is required from all previous colleges or universities (domestic and international). Applicants who enrolled in a college or university outside the U.S. must submit a [foreign credit evaluation](https://admission.gatech.edu/international/transfer) in addition to the official college transcript. Georgia Tech is unable to waive or exclude prior college credit or enrollment.

[Document Submission Options](https://admission.gatech.edu/apply/documents)

### English Proficiency

Proof of English Proficiency is required of all transfer applicants. Students satisfy this requirement by providing an official transcript showing completion of [two English Composition courses](https://catalog.gatech.edu/coursesaz/engl/) (totaling six semester credit hours).

English composition courses must be equivalent to [English 1101 and English 1102](https://catalog.gatech.edu/coursesaz/engl/) courses at Georgia Tech. English language proficiency exam scores (TOEFL, IELTS) and English taught abroad as a foreign language do not satisfy the English Proficiency requirement.

### Grade Point Average (GPA)

The minimum GPA requirement is 3.3 on a 4.0 grade scale for College of Computing and College of Engineering applicants. The minimum GPA requirement is 3.0 on a 4.0 grade scale for College of Design, College of Sciences, Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and Scheller College of Business applicants.

Students applying as part of a [transfer pathway program](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/transfer-pathway-programs) should review their pathway page for GPA information and requirements.
