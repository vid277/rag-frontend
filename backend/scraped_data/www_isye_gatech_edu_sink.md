This may be a golden age for our field. We have an abundance of data, computing power, lots of challenges facing humanity, businesses, and an enormous need for making smart decisions. We will continue our core activities in education and research, while maintaining and advancing our excellence in everything that we do. Grow our leadership, grow our impact.

In research, fundamental methods and principles from our field are going to be very important. AI is becoming center stage, and many of the foundational methods and tools in AI actually come from our field. On the education side, this calls for revisiting what we are offering, how we are offering, and maybe thinking about some transformation to meet today's and future needs. We have opportunities for leadership outside of academia as well, to influence national policies or decisions. We need to redefine our field and communicate and promote our capabilities.

# Navigating your Career during the AI Revolution

9:00 - 9:15 AM

Opening Remarks: Welcome!

Focus: Welcome and introduction, quick word about the current state of the data, analytics, data science, and AI space, purpose of the summit, plan for the day and how to gain the most value; plus a special word of encouragement (via video) from Mayor Andre Dickens.

Speaker: Joel Sokol

9:15 - 9:40 AM

Keynote Address: Data and AI as Fuel for a Transformative Future Career

Focus: Learn from this visionary leader as he delivers an inspiring keynote on the pivotal role of data and AI in shaping the careers of the future. Drawing from his extensive experience in the tech industry, hear how data and AI are not only driving innovation but also serve as essential tools for professionals looking to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market. Gain valuable insights into practical applications of data-driven strategies, and how these technologies can be harnessed to create impactful and fulfilling career paths.

Speaker: Clint Bailey

When Falcon Heavy lifted off, it became the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two. With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb)---a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel--Falcon Heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the Delta IV Heavy, at one-third the cost.

The Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering’s (ISyE) undergraduate program has been ranked the #1 program of its kind in the nation since 1991 according to the U.S. News & World Reports. While many of our students seek out our program because of our top rankings, they are equally attracted to the number of concentrations and academic interests offered. Yet one of the most alluring qualities of this program is the flexibility of career options that our Bachelor of Science (BSIE) degree allows.

We'll have a super time. Let's put in a happy little sky. Clouds have form and shape and life and are interesting, they're not just ol' dull clouds. Whatever works is good. Always doing the things furthest away first and working forward.

Soft as a meadow. Where are we going with this? You're gonna have one WILD day! Stir them up a little, then blend them. If you're gonna do mountains, it's fun to have little bumps on them here and there. Look at all those... thousands of leaves! We'll put a little mountain here. Maybe we'll do some almighty mountains today.
