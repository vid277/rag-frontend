There are a number of groups for students to join in the Woodruff School. These organizations offer a unique opportunity to learn about the many facets of mechanical engineering, meet practicing professionals, and provide valuable service to the School.

**Honor Society**

- [Pi Tau Sigma](http://pts.gtorg.gatech.edu/) \- The national honorary society of mechanical engineers. Invitations to join are extended to junior and senior mechanical engineering students who have distinguished themselves by high academic achievement. They organize several service projects and networking opportunities.

**Professional Societies**

- [Acoustical Society of America (ASA)](http://gtasa.gtorg.gatech.edu/asa/) \- A world-renowned scientific society in acoustics, dedicated to increasing and diffusing knowledge of acoustics and its practical applications. The student chapter meets regularly for activities such as tours and technical seminars, and networking opportunities.
- [American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)](http://www.asme.gatech.edu/) \- The student section of the ASME is the link for prospective mechanical engineers with their chosen profession. The section holds weekly meetings which feature presentations by practicing engineers and sponsors several annual events such as the Spring Picnic.
- [American Nuclear Society (ANS)](http://gtans.gatech.edu/site/) \- The student section of the ANS is the link for prospective nuclear engineers with their chosen profession. The section holds monthly meetings which feature presentations by practicing engineers.
- American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)
- SAE International - This group strives to further research, development, design, manufacture, and utilization of vehicles which operate on land and sea, and in air and space.
- Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) - A professional society dedicated to serving its members and the manufacturing community through the advancement of professionalism, knowledge, and learning. Members have access to the resources needed to compete in today's rapidly changing manufacturing environment.

**Competition Teams**

- [Georgia Tech CanSat Team](http://singhose.marc.gatech.edu/cansat/Home.html) \- The goal of the club is to provide students with hands-on experience in the design, construction, and launch of space systems.
- [GT Motorsports](http://gtms.gatech.edu/) \- Each academic year this team conceives, designs, builds, and tests a single seat formula race car to compete in the annual SAE Formula Competition in Pontiac, Michigan. The students are responsible for every aspect of the car, including fundraising to finance the program.
- [GT Off-Road](http://www.gtor.gatech.edu/) \- This team designs and builds a single seat vehicle from scratch. Members are trained in machining skills and make the parts they design. The only standard for the competition is a 10 hp Briggs and Stratton engine. Mini-Baja racing is under the auspices of SAE International.
- [HyTech Racing](http://hytechracing.gatech.edu/) \- HyTech Racing develops a new fully electric single seater racing vehicle every year, competing with other schools at international Formula SAE events such as Formula Hybrid and FSAE Electric. Members have opportunities to learn about all components of vehicle design and production through research, CAD design, analysis, component sourcing, project management, logistics, manufacturing, and testing.
- [RoboJackets](http://www.robojackets.org/) \- RoboJackets is a multidisciplinary organization composed of five teams - BattleBots, Outreach, IGVC, RoboCup, and RoboRacing - with a mission of promotion, education, and advancement. Their four competitive teams participate in competitions around the world, with projects spanning the mechanical, electrical, and programming disciplines. Their Outreach team mentors a local high school robotics team and is an active participant in the FIRST community. They also offer fall training for new members and attend events in the Atlanta area to promote robotics.
- [Solar Jackets](http://solarjackets.gatech.edu/) \- GT Solar Jackets is a student competition team dedicated to the design, construction, and racing of solar powered cars. Solar Jackets welcome students from all majors and skill levels to help us compete in races such as the American Solar Challenge and the World Solar Challenge, held every two years in Australia.
- [Wreck Racing](http://www.wreckracing.com/) \- Wreck Racing purchases, repairs, and modifies a car to compete in the annual Grassroots Motorsports Challenge in Gainesville, Florida. The competition consists of an autocross (speed/handling), drag race (speed in a straight line), and contours (cosmetics) judging while facing a strict budget cap.

**Student Groups**

- [Invention Studio](http://inventionstudio.gatech.edu/) \- a collective of students who believe in the value of hands on education.  It is their mission to provide students with space and resources needed to develop innovative projects in a collaborative environment and to educate the Georgia Tech community on fabrication with open, student taught classes and events.
- [Mechanical Engineering Graduate Association (MEGA)](http://mega.me.gatech.edu/) \- MEGA is the only group devoted uniquely to ME students at the Masters and PhD level, and is freely open to all ME graduate students regardless of research interest.  MEGA organizes various professional, social, and service-based events to promote a sense of community among ME grad students.
- [Woodruff School Graduate Women (WSGW)](http://www.wsgw.gatech.edu/) \- WSGW is a student group focused on the support and growth of female graduate students in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech. Activities include discussions with women in industry and academia, social gatherings to connect women within Mechanical Engineering, and outreach to prospective students.

**Advisory Committees**

- NRE Student Advisory Committee
- Woodruff School Student Advisory Committee (WSSAC) - open to all students looking to become part of the decision-making process in the Woodruff School. WSSAC advises the faculty and administration on issues that directly affect the students.
