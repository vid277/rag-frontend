## Talent Initiative Pathway Program

Georgia Tech is committed to expanding access and reducing financial barriers for students. As part of this strategic initiative and the [American Talent Initiative](https://americantalentinitiative.org/), first-year applicants not offered admission may receive a Talent Initiative Pathway offer. Students who apply to transfer and meet all the requirements of the Talent Initiative Pathway program below will receive an offer of transfer admission for the specific term and academic major.

**Computer Science Major Restriction**

All Georgia Tech majors except for Computer Science are eligible for students when applying to transfer as part of the Talent Initiative Pathway program. Due to high CS demand, we use a selective, holistic review process that considers a variety of comparative factors as part of the admission selection process for all CS transfer applicants.

Enrolling at Georgia Tech via the Transfer Initiative Pathway is not a guarantee of eligibility for student financial aid. The application for financial aid is a separate application process that all applicants are encouraged to complete by [established deadlines](https://finaid.gatech.edu/apply/transfer). Eligibility for any financial aid is determined annually.

### Pathway Requirements

To receive an offer of transfer admission through the Talent Initiative Pathway, you must:

1. **Submit a Transfer Application**


    Submit a fall transfer application by the [deadline](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/deadlines-fees). Applicants to [Architecture](https://arch.gatech.edu/) **or** [Music Technology](https://music.gatech.edu/bachelor-science-music-technology) must submit a portfolio for review by faculty as part of their application.
