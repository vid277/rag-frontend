# Ph.D. in Operations Research

![GT Building](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/2022-06/Georgia-Tech-Dining-Commons-1Hero-1.jpg)

The core strength comprising the discipline of Operations Research (OR) at Georgia Tech resides in the Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE). One of the largest programs in the country, approximately half of the entire ISyE faculty is directly responsible for the OR program through teaching and research activities that span virtually every topic and sub-discipline related to the field's basic methodologies of optimization, stochastics/applied probability and simulation. Most important, the OR faculty in the School currently counts among its members some of the most important figures in their respective concentrations, also making the program one of the strongest anywhere.

Students pursuing a degree in Operations Research (OR) are exposed to a host of research activities in the School. As one would expect from a program as large as ours, the range and depth of these activities are substantial. Depending upon your taste, your background, or your career intentions, you can engage in research that spans from the most fundamental/theoretical to work that places greater emphasis on applications. No matter your inclination, as an OR student, you can generally find several faculty doing work in your chosen concentration.

Students are attracted to our OR degree from a variety of academic disciplines and specializations. Most prominent are applicants from mathematics/mathematical sciences, theoretical computer science, and various engineering majors such as electrical and industrial engineering. However, it is not uncommon to also find qualified students from fields such as physics, economics, and statistics.

[Curriculum - All Tracks](https://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/operations-research-phd/ "(opens in a new window)")

New Ph.D. students are admitted for each Fall semester only, and the admissions process is coordinated by the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies. Decisions on applicants to our various Ph.D. programs are determined jointly by a committee of faculty members, potential faculty research advisors, and the Associate Chair. All applicants must select and apply to a specific degree program, although it is possible in some cases to switch programs after enrollment.

A prior Master's degree is not a requirement for admission into our Ph.D. programs, and students can earn an M.S. degree typically within the first two years of Ph.D. study. For those unsure about applying to a Master's program versus a Ph.D. program, please note that students in our Master's programs are not guaranteed admission into a Ph.D. program here; we do offer a simplified application scheme. If you are interested in research and a Ph.D. degree, you should apply to a Ph.D. program directly.

### Application Requirements

- **Transcripts**: Transcripts of prior academic work are required, as is evidence of an earned Bachelor's degree. Applicant transcripts should demonstrate strong academic preparation and capability, especially in advanced mathematics and computing coursework. Those with less preparation in mathematics and engineering are expected to use coursework at Georgia Tech to quickly establish proficiency.
- **Graduate Record Examination (GRE)**: Scores from the general test are required, and strong performance on the quantitative section is expected. Scores from the Mathematics Subject Test are not required, but can help a student demonstrate proficiency in advanced mathematics. **\*\*The GRE is optional for PhD applicants. The absence of scores will not affect the consideration of your application.\*\***  However, if you decide not to submit GRE scores, the rest of your academic record should make up for the lack of the test score.
- **Statement of Purpose**: The written statement of purpose should describe clearly why the applicant wishes to pursue the Ph.D., including research and career goals. While the statement should describe past experiences, it should also identify clearly the research area of interest to the applicant and the members of our faculty that might serve as research advisor(s).
- **Resume:** A resume outlining academic experience, research experience and accomplishments, industry experience, specific skills, and outside interests of the applicant is required.
- **Letters of Reference:** Three (3) credible letters of reference are required that attest to the preparation of the applicant and the likelihood for success in a Ph.D. program. At least two (2) letters should be from faculty members.

Each year, we receive many more applications from qualified students than we have the capacity to admit into our programs. To help admitted students learn more about our programs and meet potential research advisors, we hold an invitation-only Ph.D. Applicant Visit Day annually in early March.
