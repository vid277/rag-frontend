# BSIE / MS Program for SCE

## Recommended Program Plan

Undergraduate (Prior terms)

**Coursework**

- Standard BSIE program

Students enrolled in the BSIE program in ISyE are now able to apply for the BS/MS program in Supply Chain Engineering. Interested students are strongly encouraged to apply during an early application window at the end of each spring semester. Once admitted to the BS/MS program, students complete three courses in the MS SCE program while enrolled as undergraduates and enroll in the graduate program beginning in a spring semester. A recommended plan is given below.

Early applications are encouraged to provide students maximum flexibility in course scheduling. If all seats are filled during the early application window, there may be no standard application admissions for this term.
