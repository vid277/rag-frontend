# Green Goodbyes Thrift Shop Expands to Tech Square

Aug 08, 2024


Since 2021, the Green Goodbyes program has given a second life to household items that students may want to take with them when moving out of their dorm rooms or apartments. Donations have been collected at move-out since the program’s inception, but the opening of a new store in Tech Square allows for year-round operation.

Located on the second floor of Barnes & Noble at Georgia Tech (in the former BuzzCard Center), the Green Goodbyes thrift store offers all current Georgia Tech students the opportunity to shop for gently used items such as small appliances, pots and pans, dishware, and clothing, all free of charge.

### Know Before You Go:

- Green Goodbyes will open Monday, Aug. 12, during Week of Welcome.

- Store hours will be 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday during the beginning of the semester.

- Effective Aug. 26, hours will be 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday.

- Entry to the store is first-come, first-served, with a maximum of eight students in the store at a time. Expect to wait in line during peak times.

- Be prepared to transport anything you select, including large items.

- Bring your BuzzCard to verify your enrollment status.

Until now, Campus Services housed donations in storage containers and hosted a one-day event at the beginning of each semester to allow students to select items. By relocating to the new store, Campus Services aims to simplify the distribution process and benefit more students throughout the semester.

“These items have so much life left, and through this program, we can help meet the needs of our students. Whether it’s international students, who can’t travel with these items, or students who may not be able to afford to buy everything brand new, this store is going to fill a need,” said Julie Birchfield, director of Community Engagement.

Along with helping students financially, Birchfield stressed the program’s role in promoting campus sustainability.

“If not for the program, many of these items would’ve been left behind and thrown out during the move-out process. This is an excellent way to extend the useful life of household goods and clothing instead of them piling up in landfills,” she said.

### **Donating**

Item donations will be accepted during normal business hours beginning Sept. 3. Items can be dropped off inside the Green Goodbyes store. If you have a large donation, please schedule your drop-off by contacting [Julie.Birchfield@gatech.edu](mailto:Julie.Birchfield@gatech.edu).
