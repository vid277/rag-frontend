# AI4OPT and PSR Partner to Transform US Energy Industry

Jul 22, 2024


This partnership in the advancement of AI and mathematical optimization to address pressing energy transformations in Latin America and the U.S. has formed between the NSF Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research Institute for Advances in Optimization (AI4OPT) at Georgia Tech and PSR, Inc. - Energy Consulting and Analytics.

PSR is a global leader in analytical solutions for the energy sector, providing innovative technical consultancy services and state-of-the-art power systems planning software. Their tools are used for detailed modeling of entire countries or regions and are utilized in over 70 countries. Together with AI4OPT, they aim to leverage advancements in AI and mathematical optimization to address pressing energy transformations in Latin America and the U.S.

Latin America boasts abundant renewable energy resources, especially hydropower, leading to one of the largest shares of renewables in its energy mix. However, expanding renewable energy capacity in Latin America and the U.S. to meet decarbonization goals will require system operational advances and new technologies that can adapt to current needs.

One focus of this collaboration will be studying how to efficiently incorporate pumped storage into the resource mix as a solution for long-duration storage. These plants act as large batteries, pumping water to higher reservoirs during low demand periods and generating electricity during high demand with minimal energy loss over time. This technology supports both short-term and long-term energy storage, making it crucial for managing the variability of intermittent renewables like solar and wind.

The complex and large-scale nature of the expansion problem, exacerbated by inherent uncertainty and time-coupled decisions, traditionally requires sophisticated optimization techniques. AI innovations now provide faster solutions and better representations of non-linear dynamics, leading to more cost-effective operations and optimized energy mix selection for the energy transition.

This collaboration plans to use machine learning to enhance power system operators' ability to perform faster security checks and screenings. As renewable energy sources introduce more variability, traditional methods struggle with the increasing number of scenarios needed for grid stability. Machine learning offers a solution by expediting these analyses, supporting the integration of more renewable energy into the system.
