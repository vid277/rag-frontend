The Groseclose Building is home to the majority of ISyE faculty and staff. The building derives its name from the inaugural department head of ISyE, serving as head for 20 years from 1946-1966. Under Groseclose’s tenure, ISyE grew from a brand-new program to one of the nation’s best. The building consists of four floors that house faculty, staff, student labs, and additional meeting areas and conference rooms. Also housed in Groseclose is the Physical Internet Center, a concept initiated by ISyE Professor Benoit Montreuil in 2006. The visually stunning space is home to a large video wall capable of displaying many distinct sources, two 84-inch interactive SMART Boards, and a control system that provides access to the Lab’s lighting, shades, and content.

![Future Home of ISyE](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/2022-11/future-isye.jpg)

The future home of ISyE will be one befitting the No. 1 industrial engineering program in the nation. In Fall 2022, Georgia Tech officially broke ground on a new development in the heart of Tech Square. Tech Square Phase 3 will expand the Institute’s footprint in Midtown Atlanta, joining other structures like Coda, Centergy, and the Technology Square Research Building where Georgia Tech has cultivated one of the nation’s fastest-growing business and technology ecosystems. The upcoming building will be anchored by two multi-story towers. One, named the George Tower, will recognize principal donors Bill and Penny George and will be the future home of ISyE. The development will include state-of-the art academic and research facilities, a large outdoor plaza, street-level retail, and an underground parking deck.
