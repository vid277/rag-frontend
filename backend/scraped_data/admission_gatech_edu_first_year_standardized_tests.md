## Standardized Tests

**All first-year applicants must submit results from at least one SAT and/or the ACT in order to be considered for admission.** Keep in mind that in our [holistic review process](https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/application-review), tests are only one of many factors used to make admission decisions

### Self-Reported Scores

In order to complete your application more quickly, we highly recommend that you self-report your SAT and/or ACT scores via one of two methods. First, we will consider self-reported scores listed in the Common Application testing section. Additionally, after you submit your application, you will have access to a form in your admission portal to self-report scores. We will not use scores received on your school transcript or via email, fax, or postal service.

### Official Scores

**If you are admitted and choose to enroll at Georgia Tech, you will need to submit official test scores before attending orientation. Use the school codes below to submit your scores:**

- SAT school code: 5248

- ACT school code: 0818


We do not recommend paying the expedited rush fee. In our experience, test scores arrive at roughly the same time whether you pay for them to be rushed or not.

### How Do We Evaluate Test Scores?

When we evaluate your application for first-year admission we consider test scores as outlined below.

- ACT - Highest section score on English, Math, and Reading. We do not use the Science or Writing section

- SAT – Highest section score on Evidence-Based Reading & Writing and Math.

- Highest section scores on either the SAT or ACT, including paper and digital scores.


### Other Standardized Tests

AP, IB, and AS & A Level exams are optional for admission, though they may provide college credit for students who enroll at Georgia Tech. If you have taken any of these tests before you apply and you believe they support your application, you are welcome to report them as described above.

If you ultimately decide to enroll at Georgia Tech, official exam results will be required in order to seek college credit. To see our course credit by exam policy, please see below:
