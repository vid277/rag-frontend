### Order of Omega

Order of Omega was founded at the University of Miami in 1959 by a group of outstanding fraternity men, who felt that individuals in the Greek community should be recognized for their service to the fraternity community and the University.

The idea of an honorary for fraternity men at the University of Miami is attributed to Parker F. Enright, the advisor to fraternities at the time. Enright was later to accept a position at the University of Pittsburgh. He was also responsible for the founding of the Omega Chapter at the University of Pittsburgh in the spring of 1964.

On February 9, 1967, a Chapter was chartered at the University of Southern Mississippi. The Order of Omega voted to become a co-ed organization in the spring of 1977, thus honoring all outstanding fraternity and sorority members. There are now almost six hundred chapters in the United States and Canada with approximately ten new chapters being chartered each year.

To be considered, you must have at above the All Greek GPA Average and be a member of a CPC, IFC, MPC or NPHC fraternity or sorority, and have completed one full academic year at Georgia Tech. Members are chosen based on scholastic, leadership, and involvement in the Georgia Tech and Greek communities.

The Order of Omega chapter on our campus will host events throughout the year including round table discussions, guest speakers, networking events with alumni, and general meetings. Members of Order of Omega strive to develop their leadership abilities and professionalism during their involvement with this organization.
