**Category I** – Public Use:This information is targeted for general public use. Examples include Internet website contents for general viewing and press releases.

**Category II** – Internal Use:Information not generally available to parties outside the Georgia Tech community, such as directory listings, minutes from non-confidential meetings, and internal (Intranet) websites. Public disclosure of this information would cause minimal trouble or embarrassment to the Institute. This category should be the default data classification category.

**Category IV** – Highly Sensitive:Data which needs to be protected with the highest levels of security, as prescribed in contractual and/or legal specifications.

Examples of Data Categorizations can be found at [OIT's Data Categorization FAQ](https://security.gatech.edu/DataCategorization).
