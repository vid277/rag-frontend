## Institutional Fit

If you are applying to Georgia Tech, you will be reviewed through a [holistic admission process](https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/application-review) where we consider every single element of your application and weigh that in comparison not only with the applicant pool, but also with institutional priorities.

This type of evaluation means that every piece of your application is evaluated – course rigor, GPA, test scores, contribution to your community and essays. We have outlined what we look for in each portion of the application, and it is important to remember that all of these factors, not one, help us determine not only if you are an excellent student, but whether or not you would be an excellent fit here at Georgia Tech.

Holistic admission is utilized to ensure enrollment of a first-year class who will be diverse, innovative thinkers and problem solvers. A diverse class of students from many backgrounds has proven to be fertile soil for creativity. We also want a class who studies a variety of disciplines, so the major you put on your application and evidence of your interest in this major is an indicator of how you would fit in the upcoming class. These are examples of institutional priorities, and how factors outside of your GPA and test scores will affect your admission decision.

## Residency

One of the biggest impacts on likelihood of admission (admit rate) for a student is residency. As a public university, Georgia Tech aims to ensure Georgia students are the majority of enrolled students. About a month after a student submits their application, we will post a residency status for application review on a student’s Admission Portal. Students coded as Out-of-State who attend a Georgia high school will be evaluated within the context of the high school they attend.

University System of Georgia Policy determines [Tuition Classification](https://admission.gatech.edu/tuition-classification) for a student, which is the amount an enrolling student will be charged in tuition if they are admitted and choose to enroll. We will display a student’s tuition classification in the Admission Portal only after a student is admitted.
