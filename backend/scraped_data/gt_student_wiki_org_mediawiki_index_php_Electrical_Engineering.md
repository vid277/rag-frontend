**Electrical Engineering** is a Bachelors of Science program at Georgia Tech, falling under the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and within the College of Engineering. It is a discipline of engineering dedicated to the study, design, and application of any device that uses electricity or electromagnetism. Electrical engineering is a remarkably broad field. Career paths exist in [controls engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_engineering "wikipedia:Control engineering"), [power engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_engineering "wikipedia:Power engineering"), [microelectronics engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectronics "wikipedia:Microelectronics"), and [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing "wikipedia:Signal processing"). Exposure to concepts in [computer science](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Computer_Science "Computer Science") can also prepare electrical engineers for work more loosely connected to the field.
Georgia Tech's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering boasts over 1,400 undergraduate students, over 1,100 graduate students, over 20,000 alumni, and is ranked 5th in electrical engineering.[\[1\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-2) Of 163 degrees awarded in the 2020-2021 academic year, 142 recipients were male with the remaining 21 being female.[\[3\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-3)

[Eta Kappa Nu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_Kappa_Nu "wikipedia:Eta Kappa Nu") (HKN), the national electrical engineering honors society, founded its Beta Mu chapter at Georgia Tech in 1904.[\[4\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-4) Juniors with a GPA of 3.5 or higher, seniors with a GPA of 3.4 or higher, and graduate students in good standing are eligible to join HKN.[\[5\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-5) The organization hosts numerous social, corporate, and service events throughout the school year.[\[6\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-6) Two scholarships, each of $1,000, are available to one undergraduate and one junior in fall and spring, respectively.

[The Hive](https://hive.ece.gatech.edu/) is a student-led organization within the Van Leer Interdisciplinary Design Commons.[\[7\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-7) The Hive provides students with a number of tools, including 3D printers, PCB fab, wood shop, laser cutters, and electronics stations.[\[8\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-8) In order to use these machines, students must register for the "shared user management system" (or "SUMS") and undergo machine specific training.[\[9\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-9) As a student-led organization, The Hive offers volunteer positions for "Peer Instructors," who staff The Hive while general users work within the makerspace.[\[10\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-10)

[Georgia Tech IEEE](https://ieee.gatech.edu/#about), a chapter of [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers "wikipedia:Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"), provides access to the largest professional society of electrical and computer engineers.[\[11\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-11) Georgia Tech chapter of IEEE offers weekly tutoring sessions for 2000 and 3000-level electrical engineering courses, including ECE2026 and ECE 3040.[\[12\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-12) Georgia Tech IEEE offers undergraduates experience and workshops in two teams, Innovation and Hardware. The Innovation Team focuses on microcontroller programming, PCB design, and application development. The Hardware Team focuses on design and fabrication of robots, including PCB design, microcontroller programming, CAD, and manufacturing.[\[13\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-13) Georgia Tech IEEE is sponsored by relevant companies and organizations within the electrical engineering community, including Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and Northrop Grumman.[\[14\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-14)

[Women in Electrical Engineering](http://www.wece.gtorg.gatech.edu/) (or WECE) provides academic support, professional development, social events, and community outreach for female electrical engineers.[\[15\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-15) The organization was founded in Fall 2004 and is sponsored by companies like Cisco, 3M, and Qualcomm.[\[16\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-16)

## Career Paths\[ [edit](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Electrical_Engineering&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Career Paths") \| [edit source](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Electrical_Engineering&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Career Paths")\]

The ubiquity of electronics and electricity in all fields creates a number of possible positions and fields for electrical engineers. The following list is not exhaustive, further information can be found through [C2D2](https://career.gatech.edu/).

- Controls: programming and electrical design of systems used in automotive, manufacturing, and aerospace
- Embedded Systems: programming and integration of embedded systems. Dishwashers, cars, 3D printers, and WiFi routers are all examples of embedded systems
- Silicon: design and fabrication of integrated circuits and devices in personal devices or embedded systems
- Power Systems: design of electrical generation and transmission technologies, i.e. for utility companies or governments

## Is Electrical Engineering right for me?\[ [edit](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Electrical_Engineering&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Is Electrical Engineering right for me?") \| [edit source](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Electrical_Engineering&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Is Electrical Engineering right for me?")\]

It should be noted, first off, that electrical engineers enjoy a great degree of financial security in the U.S. The number of jobs available and the limited quantity of qualified engineers to fill them has driven the median annual salary of a Georgia Tech electrical engineer to $77,000.[\[17\]](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Electrical_Engineering#cite_note-17)

Options outside of engineering are also available to electrical engineers. For example, a bachelor's in EE is extremely attractive to law firms because of its application in patent law.

That being said, the curriculum for Tech's electrical engineering major is notoriously strenuous. Many classes (i.e. [ECE 2031](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/ECE_2031 "ECE 2031"), [ECE 3043](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=ECE_3043&action=edit&redlink=1 "ECE 3043 (page does not exist)")) have a strong reputation of taking far more than their allotted weekly lab times. If you find yourself struggling with math-heavy classes like [ECE 2026](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/ECE_2026 "ECE 2026") but enjoying programming-heavy classes like [ECE 2036](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/ECE_2036 "ECE 2036"), consider changing your major to [Computer Engineering](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Computer_Engineering "Computer Engineering") or [Computer Science](https://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/Computer_Science "Computer Science").
