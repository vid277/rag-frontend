### Group 2 Vertically-Integrated Projects

Please see below for a list of approved and denied VIP projects. If the project in which you are interested is not on this list, please submit the [Course Substitution Form](https://vpn.gatech.edu/https/webforms.isye.gatech.edu/undergraduate-forms/undergraduate-course-substitution "(opens in a new window)") to request that we review it for consideration as a Group 2 Engineering Elective.

To satisfy Group 2 Engineering Elective credit:

- At least three but no more than four credits of VIP coursework must be taken with the same project over 2 consecutive semesters (with exceptions for summer and co-op/internship semesters).
  - View list below for a list of projects already approved or denied
  - Upon completion of at least 3 credit hours of VIP with the same project and in 2 consecutive semesters (with exceptions for summer and co-op/internship semesters), please contact your assigned academic advisor to have the credits moved to Engineering Electives Group 2.
  - VIP counts for free elective if not used for Engineering Elective.

## Environmental Requirements

ISyE requires that a BSIE student have one course that deals with the environment. Accordingly, the following list provides a sample of acceptable courses that satisfy the environmental requirement.

### 4-HOUR LAB SCIENCE REQUIREMENTS:

- BIOS 1107 (was BIOL 1510) - Biological Principles
- BIOS 1220 - Biology of Sex and Death
- EAS 1600 - Introduction to Environmental Science
- EAS 1601 - Habitable Plant
- EAS 2600 - Earth Processes

### SOCIAL SCIENCE ELECTIVES:

- ECON 4440 - Economics of Environment

### ENGINEERING ELECTIVES:

- CEE 2300 - Environmental Engineering Principles
- CEE 4300 - Environmental Engineering Systems
- CP 2233 - Sustainable Urban Development

### FREE ELECTIVES (Courses listed above may be used as free elective as well):

- BIOS 2300 - Ecology
- BIOL 2335 - General Ecology
- EAS 2750 - Physics of the Weather
- EAS 3110 - Energy, Environ, Society
- EAS 4480 - Environ Data Analysis
- ISyE 4501 - Energy, Efficiency, and Sustainability (Offered in Fall Semester, starting in Fall 2018 - replaces ISyE 4803 below)
- (ISyE 4803 - Energy and Environmental Analysis (replaced by ISyE 4501, but will still be accepted))
- PHYS 2750 - Physics of the Weather
- SLS 3120 - Foundations of Sustainable Systems

There are other courses offered at Tech from time to time that will meet this requirement.  If you find a course that you wish to take and feel that the content qualifies, please contact your academic advisor for approval prior to enrolling.

## Matching Courses to Concentrations

To determine your Catalog Year, you will need to access your DegreeWorks (via Buzzport) and then look for the BSIE - Degree Requirements row.  At the end of that row, your Catalog Year is listed above your GPA.

![choosing catalog year](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/catalogyear.png)

### 2019-2020 (and later) Catalog year

The table lists how the various concentration courses can be used to satisfy each concentration's requirements (please refer to the [**curriculum pages**](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate#curriculum) for the other rules that still must be observed):
