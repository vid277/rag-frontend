# Entrepreneurship @ GT Computing

Entering its fourth decade as one of the highest-ranked computing programs in the country, Georgia Tech's College of Computing is home to a thriving startup culture that embraces those not content with just having a good idea.

This entrepreneurial spirit is embodied in the College's students, alumni, and faculty who have turned scores of good ideas into successful business ventures.

### John P. Imlay Series on Entrepreneurship

To highlight these entrepreneurs and inspire those that follow, GT Computing has established the John P. Imlay Jr. Series on Entrepreneurship. This series began in 2019 with profiles of GT Computing students, alumni, and faculty that are shaping the College's entrepreneurial culture. In fall 2020, we expanded the initiative to include a monthly speaker series.
