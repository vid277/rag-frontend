## Tutoring

## Shell Tutoring

With the generous support of Shell, the Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering is able to offer tutoring in the ME and COE classes listed below.  Tutoring for **Spring 2025 semester started and runs through the last day of classes. Shell tutoring is all in-person.** For virtual tutoring, check out the Knack Tutoring Program.  Tutoring runs through the last official day of class excluding final exams, official school breaks and reading days.

## **Tutoring Options**

- [Drop-In Tutoring](https://tutoring.gatech.edu/drop-in/) is provided for many of high demand courses including math, computer science, chemistry and physics. **No** **appointments are necessary**.  These sessions are offered in a combination of virtual and in-person options.
- [Knack Tutoring](https://www.joinknack.com/school/georgia-institute-of-technology) offers tutors that are fellow peers that already aced the class, and/or sign up as a Knack Tutor to help your peers in classes you have aced. They offer tutoring in many courses including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, math, computer science, physics, etc.   **All tutoring through Knack is virtual.**
- [Peer-Led Undergraduate Study (PLUS) Sessions](https://tutoring.gatech.edu/plus-sessions/) provide opportunities for students enrolled in traditionally challenging courses to work together to review course content, develop learning and study strategies, and prepare for exams. These voluntary sessions are offered several times each week and are facilitated by peer leaders (PLUS leaders) who have already successfully completed the course.  Courses include math, physics, chemistry, and more.
- [Learning Assistant Program](https://tutoring.gatech.edu/learning-assistant-program-courses-supported/) facilitates student learning and small group discussions inside the classroom.
- [Communications Center](https://communicationcenter.gatech.edu/) is available to help students with things like multimodal projects for ENGL classes and reports or presentations for upper level classes.
- [The Office of Minority Education (OMED)](https://omed.gatech.edu/) offers [several tutoring options](https://diversity.gatech.edu/students/office-minority-educational-development/omed-student-programs/academic-support) for students including walk-in tutoring services, guided study groups, study sessions, concept class reviews and focus on physics sessions.  All students are invited to these sessions.

## Academic Support

- [Academic Coaching](https://advising.gatech.edu/academic-coaching) provides students with a chance to work individually with professional staff members to improve their academic skills, confidence and performance.
- [Exploratory Advising](https://advising.gatech.edu/exploratory-advising) is a process that focuses on cross-curricular academic advising, career assessment, guided exploration of majors and careers, and programming to allow students opportunities to explore different fields; our students can discover their passions and make an informed decision on a major.
- [The Success Summit](https://advising.gatech.edu/success-summit) is a once a semester half-day program especially designed for Tech students who want to make changes and improve academically. Students attending Summit participate in a series of workshops and panels to help them set goals for the upcoming semester.
- [Reading Day Study Session](https://tutoring.gatech.edu/reading-day/) s are available at the end of each term.
- [GT2801: Study Strategies Seminar](https://advising.gatech.edu/gt2801-study-strategies-seminar) is a 1 credit, grade-bearing course for students on Academic Probation. GT2801 provides a solution-based opportunity to learn skills, strategies, and ways of thinking that will assist in restoring your scholastic standing.
