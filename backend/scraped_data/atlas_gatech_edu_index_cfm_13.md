## Non-GT Program Registration

Register for Non-GT

A Non-GT Program is one that is available through another university or organization/company that sets up programs abroad. These programs are not affiliated officially with GT, but may offer locations or courses that GT programs do not currently sponsor. Please bear in mind that your choice to study abroad through an organization other than Georgia Tech is a highly independent venture and the responsibility for completing all the necessary steps is yours.

1\. Complete the Non-GT Participant Profile by clicking the "Register for Non-GT" button above.

2. Refer to the Registrar for information on course evaluations and transferring credit from a foreign institution back to Georgia Tech. The relevant info will be under the bold heading: Non-GT sponsored Study Abroad Credit.

Georgia Tech does not sponsor programs abroad in countries under travel warning. We advise against travel and study in countries that hold a current U.S. Travel Warning. A complete list of these can be found at the [U.S. Passports and International Travel website](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html).

If you are a GT International Student: As soon as you apply to a program abroad, you MUST contact International Student and Scholar Services to review your U.S. Visa.  Please email [info@oie.gatech.edu](mailto:info@oie.gatech.edu) for more information.
