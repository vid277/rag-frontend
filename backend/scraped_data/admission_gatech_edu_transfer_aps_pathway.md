## Atlanta Public Schools (APS) Pathway Program

The APS Pathway Program is designed to provide academically talented APS students a transfer path to Georgia Tech. First-year applicants from [Atlanta Public Schools](https://www.atlantapublicschools.us/) (APS) not offered first-year admission have the opportunity to apply as a transfer student within two years after their high school graduation date. For example, first-year Fall 2023 APS applicants who received an APS Pathway program offer have until the Fall 2025 term to apply for transfer as part of the APS Pathway program.

APS Students who apply to transfer and meet all the APS Pathway requirements below will receive an offer of transfer admission for the specific term and academic major.

All Georgia Tech majors except for Computer Science are eligible for students when applying to transfer as part of the Atlanta Public Schools (APS) Transfer Pathway Program. Due to high CS demand, we use a selective, holistic review process that considers a variety of comparative factors as part of the admission selection process for all CS transfer applicants. This CS major restriction does not impact students who received an APS Pathway program offer prior to December 2023.

### Pathway Requirements

To receive an offer of transfer admission through the APS Pathway, you must:

1. **Submit a Transfer Application**


    Submit a transfer application by the [deadline](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/deadlines-fees) of the application term. APS Pathway students can apply for the spring, summer, or fall semester. The Architecture major is only available for summer and fall terms. Applicants to [Architecture](https://arch.gatech.edu/) **or** [Music Technology](https://music.gatech.edu/bachelor-science-music-technology) must submit a portfolio for review by faculty as part of their application. Admission to the Music Technology program also requires portfolio approval.

    If applying for spring or summer terms, complete minimum course requirements for your major prior to the [application deadline](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/deadlines-fees).
