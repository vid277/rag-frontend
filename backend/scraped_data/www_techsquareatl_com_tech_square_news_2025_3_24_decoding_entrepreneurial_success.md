Written By [TSQ Team](https://www.techsquareatl.com/tech-square-news?author=673d03707f71143fa5d0af0f)

In the latest episode of _Scheller Business Insights_, [Karthik Ramachandran](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/directory/faculty/ramachandran/index.html), Dunn Family Professor of Operations Management at the [Scheller College of Business](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/index.html) at Georgia Tech, explores the classic question: _Are entrepreneurs born or made?_

Drawing on his research, Ramachandran breaks down the critical skills founders need to not only launch a venture but also navigate the tough decisions that shape long-term success. From taking customer feedback to knowing when to pivot, he shares what separates the businesses that survive from the 90% that don’t.

Entrepreneurship continues to surge in the U.S., with 2024 seeing an average of 430,000 new business applications per month—a 50% increase from 2019, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury. Yet, with high failure rates, what does it truly take to beat the odds?

Watch the full episode as Ramachandran unpacks the mindset and skills every entrepreneur can develop to turn great ideas into enduring companies.
