We look forward to welcoming you to campus! We find that visiting campus is the number one way students make the decision to apply to and attend Georgia Tech. Here are some tips to help you prepare for your visit.

### Directions

Campus visits and events will be held in the John Lewis Student Center and Stamps Commons, Ferst Center for the Arts, or The Bill Moore Student Success Center. Please be sure to refer to your visit confirmation emails to see the exact check-in location for your visit.

### Parking

Parking for visitors is highlighted in orange on the map below. We recommend parking in the Visitor Area 3 parking deck (Student Center Parking Deck W02) as it is the closest parking option to the John Lewis Student Center and Stamps Commons and the Ferst Center for the Arts.  Visitor Area 1 can also be utilized if Visitor Area 3 is at capacity.

Please note: Georgia Tech Admissions does not validate visitor parking. Please visit our [GT visitor parking website](https://pts.gatech.edu/visitors#anchor2) to see the visitor parking locations and parking rates for visitor parking.

### Disability Accommodations

Below are a few of the disability accommodations we offer to campus visitors. [Disability Services](https://disabilityservices.gatech.edu/) is also available to meet with families throughout the day.  If you are interested in speaking to someone about available accommodations, please contact [Disability Services](https://disabilityservices.gatech.edu/about/contact-us) directly to request an appointment.

## Mobility Assistance

For families in need of mobility assistance, we can utilize a wheelchair accessible tour route. Campus tour guides will utilize elevators wherever possible. This route highlights the same resources and facilities as our usual route and provides a comprehensive overview of campus. If you are interested in our wheelchair accessible tour route, please [email our office](mailto:admission@gatech.edu) at least 24 hours prior to your visit.

## Hearing Impaired

If someone in your party has a hearing impairment, please [notify our office](mailto:admission@gatech.edu) a minimum of one week in advance. The admission counselor providing the information session will use a microphone to ensure that you are able to clearly hear the presentation. With advanced notice, we are able to arrange for an ASL interpreter, should a visitor need one.

## Guide Dogs

Guide dogs are welcome on campus and within all buildings. If you will be bringing a guide dog, please let us know a minimum of 24 hours in advance, so that we can inform your tour guide.

If you have additional questions, please contact [our office](mailto:admission@gatech.edu). We look forward to having you visit campus!
