## Undergraduate Admission

## Counselor Portal (Slate.org)

**What is Slate.org?**

[Slate.org](https://slate.org/) is a free tool for school counselors, independent counselors, and community-based organizations to check on student statuses in the admission process. Slate.org also allows counselors to conveniently and securely submit application-related materials directly to colleges and universities.

**How does Georgia Tech use Slate.org?**

We hope Slate.org is a helpful tool for you to upload documents, track your applicants' statuses, and receive notice of their decisions. Slate.org also allows us to convey a student’s decision to you after a student has viewed it.

**How do I register?**

Visit [Slate.org](https://slate.org/) and click the registration link in the main toolbar.

**How do permissions work?**

One member of your school will be designated to manage permissions. [Click here for an overview of how to get started](https://technolutions.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001523092-Getting-Started-Overview-School-Counselors). If you have previously submitted documents through the Common Application, you are pre-approved for a Slate.org account.

**Which documents can I upload through Slate.org?**

You can upload all transcripts (excluding the final official version), letters of recommendation and other needed materials.

**Why would I use Slate.org if my school already utilizes SCOIR, Naviance or another platform to submit documents electronically?**

It is our strong preference to receive documents electronically – whether it’s through Common App, Naviance, Parchment or a similar platform. Even if you typically utilize one of these options, there may be times you find you need to submit a corrected transcript or other non-standard document. For those of you who utilize the platforms above, Slate.org is simply another option and a great way to submit that information securely. If you work at a school that does not have access to electronic document submission, Slate.org will provide this functionality.

**How else may I utilize Slate.org?**

[Slate.org](https://slate.org/) may also be used to schedule and advertise opportunities for college representatives to visit your school.
