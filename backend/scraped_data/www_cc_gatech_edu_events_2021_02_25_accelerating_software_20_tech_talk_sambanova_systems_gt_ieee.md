Topic: Accelerating Software 2.0

Ajit Punj will discuss the transition to Software 2.0 and share how SambaNova Systems is creating the new generation of AI computing through software and hardware co-design that allows deep learning applications to run orders of magnitude faster than on traditional hardware. This will be followed up with a casual Q&A with a few of our engineers where you can learn more about SambaNova Systems, get career advice or just to socialize.

We will also be raffling off a few DoorDash gift cards (valued from $25-$50). Thank you for supporting your local economy!

Ajit Punj is a senior member of our Library/Mapping team working in the computer architecture area. He received his Masters in Electrical Engineering from Stanford and his Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from UC Davis. In his spare time, he enjoys running and walking his dog.
