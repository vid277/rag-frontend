# \# K-12 Outreach

ISyE is committed to helping increase the exposure of industrial engineering (IE) to K-12 students, educators, and the community through a variety of educational programs and outreach activities. Oftentimes, K-12 students and educators do not know what industrial engineers do or that IE is an option in the vast field of engineering.

![Students walking](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/2022-10/13.jpg)

We would like to change that by increasing our knowledge of the field through summer programs, workshops, games, and other outreach activities. Key areas of focus in these programs are to enhance STEM education and encourage underrepresented minorities to the field.

## **Seth Bonder Summer Camp in Computational and Data Science**

The [Seth Bonder Summer Camp in Computational and Data Science](https://www.ai4opt.org/seth-bonder-camp "(opens in a new window)") is intended for high school students with little or no background in data science and computer programming and an interest in engineering. The camp only requires that participants are able to use a browser and have the desire to learn computational and data science through meaningful and exciting applications in machine learning, optimization, computational social science, and genomics.

## **iExperience**

iExperience (formerly IE Days) is a Center for Academics, Success, & Equity (CASE) initiative that exposes underserved high school students from local Georgia high schools to the programs and services that are offered through the H. Milton School of Industrial & Systems Engineering. High school students who participate in the iExperience will gain insight into the life of an undergraduate ISyE student at Georgia Tech. iExperience is divided into three distinct phases.

## **Class Visits for High School Students**

![Students in a classroom](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/2022-09/high_school_students-stock.jpg)

High school 10th-12th graders are invited to observe an ISyE probability and statistics class to get a better understanding of what it is like to be an ISyE student. During the visit, they will also enjoy lunch with current students and tour the Georgia Tech campus. Participants must be currently enrolled in, or have successfully completed, AP statistics in order to participate in this visit.

## **Professional Development for Teachers**

Would you like to incorporate industrial engineering methodologies and applications into your curriculum? If so, ISyE can help. Industrial engineering tools can be used to enhance a variety of subjects, and ISyE faculty are available upon request to help local high schools incorporate such content into their curriculum.

## **Informational Visits to Local High Schools**

![Teacher teaching](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/2022-09/11c1605-p1-004.jpg)

Local high schools are encouraged to schedule an informational visit from ISyE representatives to give students a better understanding of the School and industrial engineering as a major. Students will view a one-hour presentation given by an ISyE faculty member and a current student.

#### Curriculum Development: Project MINDSET

ISyE’s Dave Goldsman has developed operations research and industrial engineering instructional modules, Project MINDSET (Mathematics Instruction using Decision Science and Engineering Tools), aimed at high school students. Some of this work evolved into a high school OR/IE course that is currently offered in a number of states, including Georgia.

#### Interactive Game: Theme Park

Theme Park, an engaging interactive computer game geared towards the learning of probability and statistics, was developed by ISyE’s Ton Dieker for high school students in grades nine through 12. As students analyze, maneuver, construct, and synthesize information throughout the game, they gain a deeper understanding of a variety of topics in probability and statistics, while applying these concepts to a real-world situation.
