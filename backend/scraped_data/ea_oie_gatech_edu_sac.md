The Study Abroad Committee (SAC) is a joint subcommittee of the Institute Graduate Committee (IGC) and the Institute Undergraduate Curriculum Committee (IUCC).  Its function is to act for its parent committees on academic matters related to study abroad programs. The Study Abroad Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on Study Abroad and Global at Home programs and the policies that govern them. More information about Georgia Tech Faculty-led Study Abroad Program policies and procedures can be [found here](https://ea.oie.gatech.edu/faculty-staff).

## FAQ

### What is the difference between a Faculty-led Study Abroad Program and an Embedded Program?

Faculty-led Study Abroad Programs typically take place over the course of a fall, spring, or summer semester. Embedded Programs are faculty-led and include short-term international travel that takes place as part of a regular Atlanta campus course. The majority of Embedded Programs take place during spring break. Embedded Programs follow the same program proposal submission process.

### What is the difference between a Study Abroad Program and a Global at Home Program?

Faculty-led Study Abroad Programs are group/cohort based study abroad programs, led by Georgia Tech faculty and include international travel. This also includes Embedded Study Abroad Programs. For more information about Faculty-led Study Abroad and Embedded Programs, email Mary Alice Allen at [maryalice.allen@oie.gatech.edu](mailto:maryalice.allen@oie.gatech.edu).

Global at Home Programs are globally focused group/cohort-based programs, led by Georgia Tech faculty, which includes courses and program content offered in Atlanta, in the domestic United States, and/or virtually. These programs do not include international travel. For more information about Global at Home Programs, email Ashlee Toomey-Flinn at [ashlee.flinn@oie.gatech.edu](mailto:ashlee.flinn@oie.gatech.edu).

### Will the committee review an incomplete proposal?

The committee understands the time commitment and work required of Program Directors to submit the necessary proposal components. Due to the number of proposals received each year and time required to review each proposal, the committee will no longer review proposals that are not complete or missing approval signatures.

### Are proposals accepted after the deadline?

Proposals for existing programs are accepted based on the published timeline. Proposals for new programs may be submitted outside of this timeline. No proposals will be accepted less than 90 days prior to the program's proposed departure.

### I'm unsure how to complete the program budget, where can I seek support?

Reach out to Mary Alice Allen in the Office of International Education at [maryalice.allen@oie.gatech.edu](mailto:maryalice.allen@oie.gatech.edu) to request a meeting. Mary Alice will assist you in understanding the different accounts for study abroad, discuss how these are maintained, and provide guidance on how to build and maintain a sustainable budget for your proposed study abroad program.

### How do I proceed after my proposal has been approved?

The Office of International Education offers several resources for new and existing program directors at [https://ea.oie.gatech.edu/faculty-staff](https://ea.oie.gatech.edu/faculty-staff). Some important resources include the Program Director Manual for Faculty-led Study Abroad Programs, Education Abroad Policy, links to Travel and Procurement Policy, and Faculty and Staff Protocols for Study Abroad.
