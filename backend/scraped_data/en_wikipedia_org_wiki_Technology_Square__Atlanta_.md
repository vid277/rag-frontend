## History

\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technology_Square_(Atlanta)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Atltechsquare2.jpg/500px-Atltechsquare2.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atltechsquare2.jpg) Tech Square at night

Announced in 2000[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-3) and opened in 2003,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-4) the district designed by [tvsdesign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tvsdesign "Tvsdesign")[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-5) was built over previously vacant surface parking lots and has contributed to an ongoing revitalization of the Midtown neighborhood. In October 2013, Georgia Tech and local businesses celebrated Tech Square's 10th anniversary.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-6)

In 2007, the [Georgia Tech Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Foundation "Georgia Tech Foundation") purchased the [Crum & Forster Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crum_%26_Forster_Building "Crum & Forster Building"), located in Tech Square, and sought permits to demolish the building as part of a plan to expand Technology Square.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-AJC-7) The building was designed in the 1920s by the architectural firm of [Ivey and Crook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivey_and_Crook "Ivey and Crook"), whose founders Ernest Ivey and Lewis Crook helped establish the [Architecture program at Georgia Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology_College_of_Architecture "Georgia Institute of Technology College of Architecture") in 1908.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-AJC-7) Preservationists fought the demolition and in August 2009, the Atlanta City Council and Mayor [Shirley Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Franklin "Shirley Franklin") granted the building protective status as a historic landmark.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-Technique-8) The Georgia Tech Foundation appealed this decision. It instead purchased an adjoining property where a [SunTrust Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunTrust_Banks "SunTrust Banks") branch was previously located. In September 2013, the Georgia Tech Foundation demolished two-thirds of the Crum & Forster Building, leaving only part of its facade, to clear space for the [CODA Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CODA_(mixed-use_development) "CODA (mixed-use development)").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-9)

Further expansion occurred in 2008, when Georgia Tech acquired the [Academy of Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Medicine_(Atlanta) "Academy of Medicine (Atlanta)"), and in 2016 when Tech bought the [Atlanta Biltmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Biltmore_Hotel_and_Biltmore_Apartments "Atlanta Biltmore Hotel and Biltmore Apartments").[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-11) Both of these buildings are designated as [landmark buildings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historic_buildings_and_districts_designated_by_the_City_of_Atlanta "List of historic buildings and districts designated by the City of Atlanta") by the city of Atlanta.

In 2015, construction began on the CODA Building, what was initially referred to as the High Performance Computing Center.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-12) The 21-story building is one of the largest buildings in Tech Square, with Georgia Tech serving as the anchor tenant of the building and leasing out additional offices to other companies.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-13) Construction was completed on the CODA Building in 2019, with the building being used as office space for [GTRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech_Research_Institute "Georgia Tech Research Institute").[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-14) The food court of CODA hosts such restaurants as Aviva by Kameel, El Burro Pollo, Poke Burri, and Humble Mumble.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Square_(Atlanta)#cite_note-15)
