## Personal Essays

Two essays of 300 words each (max) are required as part of the transfer application. The purpose of the essays is to assess your writing ability and, more importantly, to learn more about you as an individual. This portion of the application helps us get to know you, assess mutual fit and better understand what you could contribute to Georgia Tech.

### What Are We Looking for in Your Essays?

Essays are evaluated for both content and writing/grammatical skills. So, before submitting your application, you should take the time to edit and review your essay thoroughly. The traits of a strong essay include ones that:

- Demonstrate authenticity.

- Brings you to life on paper.

- Are excellent in topic, style, and grammar.

- Demonstrate thoughtfulness.

- Demonstrate a student has thought about why Georgia Tech, specifically, is a fit for them and how their goals align with [Georgia Tech’s Values](https://www.gatech.edu/about). The Georgia Institute of Technology is a public research university established by the state of Georgia in Atlanta in 1885 and committed to developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition.


### Our Advice for this Portion of the Application

* * *

- Get started early. Don’t wait until the last minute to complete your essays!

- Write and edit your essay in a document editor. Once you have the final draft, you can cut and paste it into your online application.

- Don’t overthink it. It may not be easy to write about yourself, but just write what you feel most comfortable with.

- Don’t write what you think we want to read. Write what you want to say!

- In the same way you would not copy directly from any other source you may incorporate into the writing process; you should not copy and paste directly out of any AI platform or submit work that you did not originally create. Instead, approach and consider any interaction with an AI tool as a learning experience that may help you generate ideas, provide alternative phrasing options, and organize your thoughts. Ultimately, we want to read and hear your unique and valuable writing style.
