# Georgia Tech Tops Best Value College Lists

Jun 21, 2024


For the second year in a row, Georgia Tech has earned the top spot on the Princeton Review's [Best Value Colleges](https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50-best-value-colleges-public-schools) list.

The educational services company evaluated 650 public and private schools to determine the "most exceptional in the nation at delivering great academics, affordable cost, and great career foundations."

The Institute leads all public colleges based on the formula, which considers return on investment, academics, financial aid, quality of life, and overall costs, among other factors.

Additionally, Georgia Tech ranked No. 1 among public universities in career placement, No. 5 for its alumni network, and No. 5 on the list of Best Schools for Making an Impact — which gauges community service opportunities, sustainability efforts, and on-campus student engagement.

Georgia Tech has also retained its standing as a five-star institution according to _Money_ magazine’s formula highlighting quality, affordability, and outcomes. Naming the Institute among [America’s Best Colleges](https://money.com/best-colleges/profile/georgia-institute-of-technology-main-campus/), the publication praised its diverse research opportunities for students and lofty median salaries upon graduation.

Tech has recently received similar accolades — from being named to [_Forbes Magazine's_ list of “new Ivies”](https://news.gatech.edu/news/2024/05/08/forbes-ranks-georgia-tech-new-ivies-list) to [_Bloomberg's_ recognition of its high ROI](https://news.gatech.edu/news/2024/04/16/bloomberg-report-highlights-georgia-tech-roi).
