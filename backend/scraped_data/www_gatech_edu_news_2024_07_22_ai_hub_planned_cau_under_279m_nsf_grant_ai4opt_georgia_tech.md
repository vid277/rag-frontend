# AI Hub Planned for CAU Under $2.79M NSF Grant with AI4OPT at Georgia Tech

Jul 22, 2024


Clark Atlanta University (CAU), in collaboration with Georgia Tech’s NSF Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research Institute for Advances in Optimization (AI4OPT), has been awarded a four-year $2.79 million grant ( [Award ID 2402493](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2402493)) by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create an AI Hub. This collaborative effort aims to advance AI education and research at minority-serving institutions, particularly historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).

This initiative, part of the NSF [ExpandAI](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/expanding-ai-innovation-through-capacity-building) program, aims to boost minority-serving institution participation in AI research, education, and workforce development through capacity-building projects and partnerships within the NSF-led National AI Research Institutes ecosystem.

Building an AI community is no easy feat, but the CAU-GT/AI4OPT collaboration is prepared to meet it. The project, known as AIHUB@CAU, will be led by principal investigator Charles B. Pierre, associate professor in CAU’s Department of Mathematical Sciences.

"The mission of the grant aligns with the AI4OPT Faculty Training Program, which focuses on strategies to increase minority participation in AI research programs from HBCUs to other minority-serving institutions," said Pierre, who also leads the Educational and Diversity Initiatives at AI4OPT. "Our goal is to ensure diverse representation in the AI field."

The collaboration will use existing educational resources and infrastructure to build centers of excellence in AI and a community of empowered Black AI researchers.

"We anticipate challenges in developing coursework, including finding qualified industry professionals to teach and preparing academic professors unfamiliar with AI," Pierre said. "Our aim is to establish Ph.D. programs at CAU and position the university as a hub for AI training, addressing these issues head-on."

AIHUB@CAU will integrate industry partnerships to accelerate curriculum development and real-world applications. It expands AI education beyond machine learning to encompass decision-making and applications in fields like business analytics, cyber-physical security, and operations research.

Partially funded through NSF's [Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/louis-stokes-alliances-minority-participation) program, this award underscores NSF's commitment to diversity in STEM fields through impactful educational and research initiatives.

"Establishing programs at institutions like Clark Atlanta University and AI4OPT at Georgia Tech provides students with essential resources and tools to succeed in this ever-evolving field," Pierre noted.

**Goals and Structure of the AI Education Program**

**Main Goals of Creating AI Courses at the Undergraduate and Graduate Levels:**

- Close the gap of AI graduates from HBCUs at undergraduate and graduate levels.
- Prepare HBCU students for the AI workforce.
- Align with the vision of AI4OPT at Georgia Tech to "democratize access to AI education."

**Impact on Students' Career Prospects and the AI Research Community:**

- Undergraduate courses and programs will prepare students for entry-level positions in the field.
- Graduate courses and programs will prepare students for research and participation in the AI research community.

**Role and Contribution:**

- AI4OPT at Georgia Tech will assist CAU with the development of both undergraduate and graduate courses and programs.
- Offer research opportunities to CAU students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
- AI4OPT at Georgia Tech will be a partner in the established AI Research Hub.

**Support for Development of MS and Ph.D. Courses:**

- Use current courses at Georgia Tech as a template.
- Use the courses offered through the Faculty Training Program (FTP) of AI4OPT.

**Foundational AI Courses:**

- Courses already taught by CAU faculty in the AI4OPT FTP.
- Courses available at Georgia Tech.
- New courses to be developed by AIHUB@CAU based on Intel material, focusing on computer vision and natural language processing.
- Courses in applied optimization developed by AI4OPT.
- New use-inspired AI courses teaching applications of AI in various domains, such as supply chains, security, chemistry, and manufacturing.

**Research Opportunities:**

- The Undergraduate Research Program (URP) will provide students with early exposure to AI research, including summer internships at Georgia Tech and other AI4OPT sites.
- The graduate programs will include an 18-month non-thesis master's degree with a summer internship and capstone project, and a two-year thesis master's degree supported by a six-month research project.

**Structure of the New Master in AI Program:**

- Courses in five categories to support the master’s program:
1. Existing courses at CAU taught in the AI4OPT FTP.
2. Courses available at Georgia Tech.
3. New courses based on Intel material.
4. Applied optimization courses developed by AI4OPT.
5. New courses developed by AIHUB@CAU focusing on AI applications in various domains.

**Collaborations and Internships:**

- Joint supervision of research projects by CAU and AI4OPT faculty.
- Summer internships starting in 2026.
- Capstone projects facilitated by Georgia Tech and industrial partners.

**About AI4OPT**

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research Institute for Advances in Optimization, or AI4OPT, aims to deliver a paradigm shift in automated decision-making at massive scales by fusing AI and Mathematical Optimization (MO) to achieve breakthroughs that neither field can achieve independently. The Institute is driven by societal challenges in energy, logistics and supply chains, resilience and sustainability, and circuit design and control. To address the widening gap in job opportunities, the Institute delivers an innovative longitudinal education and workforce development program.

**About Georgia Tech**

The Georgia Institute of Technology, or Georgia Tech, is a top 10 public research university developing leaders who advance technology and improve the human condition. The Institute offers business, computing, design, engineering, liberal arts, and sciences degrees. Its nearly 40,000 students, representing 50 states and 149 countries, study at the main campus in Atlanta, at international campuses, and through distance and online learning. As a leading technological university, Georgia Tech is an engine of economic development for Georgia, the Southeast, and the nation, conducting more than $1 billion in research annually for government, industry, and society.

**About Clark Atlanta University**

Clark Atlanta University was formed with the consolidation of Atlanta University and Clark College, both of which hold unique places in the annals of African American history. Atlanta University, established in 1865 by the American Missionary Association, was the nation’s first institution to award graduate degrees to African Americans. CAU is also the largest of the 37-member UNCF institutions. CAU, established four years later in 1869, was the nation’s first four-year liberal arts college to serve a primarily African American student population. Today, with over 4,000 students, CAU is the largest of the four institutions (CAU, Morehouse College, Spelman College, and Morehouse School of Medicine) that comprise the Atlanta University Center Consortium.

**About National Science Foundation**

The U.S. National Science Foundation propels the nation forward by advancing fundamental research in all fields of science and engineering. NSF supports research and people by providing facilities, instruments and funding to support their ingenuity and sustain the U.S. as a global leader in research and innovation. With a fiscal year 2023 budget of $9.5 billion, NSF funds reach all 50 states through grants to nearly 2,000 colleges, universities and institutions. Each year, NSF receives more than 40,000 competitive proposals and makes about 11,000 new awards. Those awards include support for cooperative research with industry, Arctic and Antarctic research and operations, and U.S. participation in international scientific efforts.
