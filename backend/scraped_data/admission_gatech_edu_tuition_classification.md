## Tuition Classification

Per Georgia law, every [University System of Georgia (USG)](https://www.usg.edu/policymanual/section4/C329/) student must be assigned a tuition classification that determines their tuition rate.

Lawful Presence Verification (LPV) is required of every student who receives an in-state tuition classification and/or receiving an out-of-state tuition waiver in accordance with BOR [Policy 4.3.4](https://www.usg.edu/policymanual/section4/C329/).

## Tuition Classification Review

Tuition classification information is listed within your Admission Portal prior to decision release. In some cases, an [out-of-state tuition waiver application](https://catalog.gatech.edu/financial/assistance/ugrad/out-of-state-waiver/) or [petition for tuition classification](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/petition-tuition-classification) may be required after a student receives an offer of admission. The [Registrar’s Office](https://registrar.gatech.edu/) reviews and makes final decisions on all waiver applications and petitions for tuition classification.
