## Transfer Pathway Programs

Transfer pathways offer an alternative route to the traditional transfer application process for qualified students.

A variety of transfer pathways are available to students with interest in transferring to Georgia Tech. Dual Degree and Regent’s Engineering Pathway Program (REPP) pathway programs are connected to Georgia Tech’s College of Engineering.

Transfer pathway programs marked with an asterisk (\*) are only available to eligible students who previously applied to Georgia Tech as a first-year applicant.
