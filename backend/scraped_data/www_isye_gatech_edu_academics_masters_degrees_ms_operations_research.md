# Master of Science in Operations Research

The Master of Science in Operations Research (MSOR) degree program focuses on the theory and practice of operations research through a program of rigorous graduate-level coursework. Coursework focuses on deterministic and stochastic operations research with electives in statistics and data analytics, and students in the program can choose between introductory and advanced Ph.D. level courses depending on background and interest.

The program, which can be completed in twelve to sixteen months, is designed to provide students with competence in the principles and methods essential to operations research. Students work with faculty actively engaged in research and prepared to teach the latest developments in operations research. MSOR students do not complete a research thesis, but may apply for follow-on Ph.D. study.

The MS OR program consists of 30 credit hours with core courses taken in ISyE, Math, and Computer Science. Choices of the remaining courses in the program are quite flexible; students in the program can concentrate their studies on a specific area of application such as Optimization, Statistics, Stochastics, Computational Science, etc. or, in preparation for a Ph.D., can take more mathematical courses. MSOR students are also encouraged to take one course focused on applied operations research.

Applicants typically hold an undergraduate degree in engineering, mathematics, science, or computing and have strong quantitative skills. Prior background in operations research is not required.

Admissions to the Master's degree programs offered by the Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering are conducted by the School and coordinated by the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies.  Please note that admissions offers will generally not include any form of financial assistance; School assistantship funds are dedicated to Ph.D. students.  Students with an interest in research should apply directly to our Ph.D. program.

Students seeking admission to a Master’s degree program must complete an application using Georgia Tech's online application system, accessible via the [Graduate Studies website](https://grad.gatech.edu/admissions "(opens in a new window)").  Students may apply for admission in Fall semester only, with exceptions approved by the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies.

Can I start my Master's degree program in Spring semester?

This is discouraged for new Master's students. In rare cases, some students may begin in Spring but our course sequence is designed for Fall semester entrants. Please contact the [Associate Chair for Graduate Studies](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/user/47/contact) if you are interested in beginning your program in Spring semester.

Do I qualify for admission?

We are not able to make admissions evaluations via email.  Once you complete a formal and complete application, it will be given the consideration it deserves.  The admissions process will examine the applicant’s prior academic performance, including our sense of the rigor of prior degrees and their institutions, GRE scores, personal statement and recommendation letters.

Do you accept the IELTS?

Yes, the IELTS exam is accepted. See here for score requirements: [https://www.grad.gatech.edu/english-proficiency](https://www.grad.gatech.edu/english-proficiency "(opens in a new window)")

Do you accept transfer credit?

Transfer credit is accepted only in rare cases, and must be approved by the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies, ISyE.  A maximum of six credit hours are transferrable.  A transfer credit request should be submitted to the Academic Office in a student's first semester.

Do you offer an online option?

MS in Industrial Engineering as well as MS in Operations Research are offered as Distance Learning (online) degree programs.

See here for more information on our online degrees: [https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees#tab-master-of-science-degrees](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees#tab-master-of-science-degrees "(opens in a new window)")

Does ISyE provide financial support for M.S. students?

Since the graduate program in the Stewart School is exceptionally large, we have adopted a policy regarding financial aid that is perhaps somewhat different than that pursued by other, smaller programs. Generally, ISyE does not offer funding support to Master's applicants, and it is rare that our faculty offer TA/RA support (especially in a student's first semester) to Master's students. Occasionally, a Master's student might be offered a paying position, but this is usually in a student's second or third semester, and students should never send mass emails to faculty soliciting financial support. Should opportunities arise for Master's students, the Academic Office will send a mass email to all students.

Does it make sense to enroll in the M.S. in Supply Chain Engineering program if my ultimate goal is to receive a Ph.D.?

It could be. The M.S. in Supply Chain Engineering is a practice-focused degree and could be good preparation for Ph.D. study in supply chain applications especially for students who do not have much real-world work experience. Quantitative methods for supply chain engineering are covered in depth. However, the primary purpose of the degree is to prepare graduates for industrial practice and not for research.

How do I check the status of my application?

Applicants should track their status through the CollegeNet online status check at: [http://www.gradadmiss.gatech.edu/status-checking](http://www.gradadmiss.gatech.edu/status-checking "(opens in a new window)")

While it is possible to earn an on-campus M.S. degree while working full time, it will require attending courses during the workday. Contact the [Associate Chair for Graduate Studies](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/user/47/contact) for more information.

Is the GRE and TOEFL (if applicable) required at the time of application?

No. You can apply without having available scores, however official test scores must be received prior to officially being granted admission to Georgia Tech.

Is work experience required?

While work experience is not a requirement for admission, it is viewed favorably by the admissions committee when reviewing an application.

May I apply for more than one program?

Technically, yes. However, an applicant can enroll in only one degree program.

My country’s primary language is English, do I still need to provide a TOEFL score?

Exceptions are given to applicants from countries where English is the SOLE OFFICIAL language of instruction.  An applicant is also exempt if they have studied for at least one academic year at a U.S. college or university.  Please visit [http://catalog.gatech.edu/admissions/grad/toefl/p](http://catalog.gatech.edu/admissions/grad/toefl/ "(opens in a new window)") for further information on TOEFL requirements for international students.

My GRE exam date is scheduled after the application deadline. Can I still apply?

Yes, you can still apply. However, we can only guarantee a review (and decision) of an application for those who submit a complete application by the deadline.

What are the differences between the M.S. Supply Chain Engineering program and the M.S. Industrial Engineering program? Can't I find a supply chain position with either degree?

The MSIE degree is earned solely through completing a set of coursework, and only offers a few courses that touch on supply chain applications of industrial engineering and operations research. It is a broader degree. The MSSCE provides depth of coverage in supply chain engineering, with a special limited enrollment set of courses. Many MSSCE courses feature class projects conducted for industry partners. Students also complete a Capstone Project experience with industry. If you want hands-on experience in your degree program, the MSSCE may be a better choice for you.

What are the financial document requirements for international students?

For clarification on what the requirements are for international students who will need an I-20, please review the Preparation & Arrival guide under the OIE website: [https://oie.gatech.edu/content/international-student-scholar-services?qt-isss\_quicktabs=3&qt-isss\_quicktabs\_jscholar=2](https://oie.gatech.edu/isss/home?qt-isss_quicktabs=3&amp%3Bqt-isss_quicktabs_jscholar=2 "(opens in a new window)")
