## Undergraduate Admission

## Visa Process and Tuition Classification

For the purpose of immigration and tuition classification, Georgia Tech defines a student or applicant as "international" if they meet any of the criteria below:

- You do not have U.S. citizenship or U.S. Lawful Permanent Residency.

- You require a visa to enter and study in the United States.


Prior to enrollment in classes, each student must identify if U.S. federal laws permit enrollment in classes for the category of admission granted by Georgia Institute of Technology. When the current visa type does not permit enrollment in classes or there are restrictions on enrollment that conflict with the admission being granted, it is the responsibility of the student to pursue the necessary steps to change visa status with the USCIS prior to the start of the semester of admission.

The State of Georgia requires Georgia Institute of Technology verify lawful presence of all students prior to enrollment in classes. Students currently in the United States with any status, other than an F-1 or J-1, must submit a copy of evidence of lawful status such as an entry stamp, I-94 record or I-797 notice of action through your [admission portal](http://application.gatech.edu/apply/status) or by fax (404.894.9511).

### Tuition and Immigration

## Cost of Attendance

Non-U.S. citizens or Permanent Residents are not able to receive federal or state sponsored financial aid. Likewise, Georgia Tech typically does not have scholarships or financial aid available for international students. International students holding an F-1 study visa are typically able to participate in paid internships, co-ops, and research as well as on campus jobs. These opportunities can help to supplement the cost of a Georgia Tech education, but are not guaranteed and will not cover the full cost of attendance.

Students are responsible for showing sufficient funding after admission (see Student Visa Information).

## Tuition Classification

Students categorized as “international” will be considered a non-Georgia resident for tuition classification. If you are a U.S. Citizen or Permanent Resident, you will be classified as a "regular" applicant; however, tuition classification would then be determined by state residency.

- If you are a Permanent Legal Resident of the United States, please submit a copy of the front and back of your green card for inspection after submission of the online application.

- If you are in the process of obtaining permanent legal residency, please submit all documentation related to this process. This would include, but is not limited to, an Employment Authorization Document, Form I-485, or I-94 departure record.

- If you hold refugee or asylum status, please fax all documentation related to this status.


**Please submit any documentation regarding Permanent Residency by fax (404.894.9511) or email to your designated admission counselor.**

## Student Visa Information

Georgia Tech is authorized under Federal law to enroll nonimmigrant alien students. Admitted students who require a student visa in order to enter the U.S. and be eligible to enroll in classes at Georgia Tech will be issued the appropriate immigration documentation.

The [Office of International Education](http://www.oie.gatech.edu/) (OIE) will be responsible for determining eligibility based on your admission to Georgia Tech and information you provide during the immigration document request process. Students should contact OIE at 404.894.7475 or [info@oie.gatech.edu](mailto:info@oie.gatech.edu) to schedule an appointment with any concerns about eligibility for an F-1 or a J-1 visa.

**The immigration document (I-20 or DS-2019) request process will not begin until after you have been admitted and paid the non-refundable $250 admission deposit.** You will receive further instructions via email regarding the request process after the admission deposit has been submitted online.
