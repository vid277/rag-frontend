## Undergraduate Admission

## Admission Decision Appeals

The Georgia Institute of Technology has far more qualified applicants than space available, and each year we are unable to admit all students who are qualified to attend. Our team is committed to ensuring every application is reviewed thoroughly and comprehensively. Due to this holistic and rigorous review, it is unusual for us to reverse an admission decision, meaning most appeals do not result in a change to a student’s decision.

For an appeal to have merit it must provide an update to information in the application or academic record that was incorrect at the time of application submission —information that clearly shows the student to be stronger than had been earlier evidenced.

Please read below to better understand what does and does not constitute an appeal. We advise you to consider this information carefully before you decide to submit an appeal.

## Valid Circumstances for an Appeal

| Valid Basis for an Appeal | Appropriate Supporting Documents |
| --- | --- |
| **Grade Error**<br> You or your school discovered an error on on your transcript that resulted in a change in a grade submitted to us. | High school and/or college transcript that shows a change in grade(s) from those originally submitted with your application. |
| **Georgia Tech Scholar or APS Scholar**<br> You believe you have met all requirements for the [Georgia Tech Scholars](https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/gtscholars) or [APS Scholars](https://admission.gatech.edu/aps) program. | High school transcript or letter from counselor/school official documenting class rank. |
| **Transfer Pathway Applicants**<br> You believe you have met all the minimum pathway requirements as outlined on your [pathway homepage](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/transfer-pathway-programs). | Official transcripts from all previous colleges and reported test scores. |

## Information NOT Considered

- Appeals written or submitted by someone other than the student for whom the decision was rendered.
- Grades, test scores, activities, etc that are obtained after your application will not be considered in an appeal. For example, if you have a new semester of grades once a decision is released, those will not be considered.
- Personal circumstances (medical, family concerns, etc) not disclosed on your application will not be considered in an appeal. Any personal circumstances that were disclosed on your application have already been considered in our review and will not be reconsidered in an appeal.
- Additional letters of recommendation.
- Interviews with an admission counselor.
- Interest in attending Georgia Tech.

## Steps to Request an Appeal

1. [Contact us](https://admission.gatech.edu/contact) to discuss the appeal process and request an appeal form.If an admission staff member determines an appeal is valid, we will post the appeal form to your admission portal.
2. Log into your [admission portal](https://application.gatech.edu/apply/status) to access the appeal form via your application checklist. Only information uploaded with your appeal form will be considered. Please do not mail appeal information. Appeals submitted by anyone other than the student will not be considered.
3. Your appeal will be reviewed by the Undergraduate Admission Committee, and then you will be notified of your admission decision.

## Appeal Deadlines

- First-year applicants – Two weeks after you receive your admission decision. \*Students named Val or Sal of a Georgia high school may request an appeal past their appeal window if they are later notified of their Val/Sal status.
