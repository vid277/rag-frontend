# Georgia Tech Commits to Doubling Educational Reach

Sep 05, 2024


As one of the country’s fastest-growing universities and one of the largest in the state, Georgia Tech is taking steps to expand access to lifetime educational opportunities.

Today, the Institute announced the launch of its new [College of Lifetime Learning](https://lifetimelearning.gatech.edu/), a cornerstone initiative in its commitment to double the number of degrees granted and non-degree learners reached by 2030. The announcement was made at the annual Institute Address by Georgia Tech President Ángel Cabrera, who emphasized the Institute's dedication to transformative education.

The College of Lifetime Learning is the result of a multiyear effort to respond to evolving industry demands and the global economy. As technology advances and workforce requirements change, continuous learning becomes increasingly important for job security and flexibility. The College will offer programs that elevate the academic study of learning and transform the future of education, from K-12 to post-retirement, ensuring that education is accessible at every stage of life.

Since 2019, Georgia Tech has seen significant growth:

- A 44% increase in degree-seeking students, from 35,630 to 51,431.
- More than double the number of participants in non-degree-seeking programs, from 28,609 to 71,048.

The College of Lifetime Learning is set to propel this growth even further, aiming to serve 114,000 learners by 2030.

“Georgia Tech is committed to expanding access to high-quality education and ensuring that all learners, regardless of their background or the stage of their career, have the opportunity to succeed and get ahead,” Cabrera said. “With our new College, we will provide a pathway for learners of every stripe to acquire the skills and tools they need to respond to the changing demands of the workplace and advance their careers.”

Today's announcement aligns with Georgia Tech's refreshed Institute strategic plan, which focuses on four key strategic priorities, or [Big Bets](https://strategicplan.gatech.edu/):

**1\. Be** **a** **national** **leader** **in outcomes and ROI for all students**: Lead in student outcomes, including graduation rates, employment success, and return on investment for all students — regardless of income level.

**2.** **Double** **the** **number** **of** **degrees** **granted** **and** **non**- **degree** **learners**: Expand our academic reach, serve more students and non-degree learners of all ages and backgrounds, and become the leading source of tech-savvy leaders in the nation to drive innovation and create economic opportunity.

3\. **Double** **the** **scale** **and** **impact** **of** **research**: Double research expenditures, particularly in key areas like medical innovation, AI, and sustainability, and enhance infrastructure to support cutting-edge research.

**4.** **Build** **a** **dynamic** **hub** **of** **innovation** **and** **entrepreneurship**: Establish Georgia Tech as a top hub for innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship, significantly increasing the number of companies created and supported, and contributing to Atlanta's emergence as a leading startup city.

"As our society and the economy evolve at an unprecedented pace, learning must be a lifelong endeavor," said Nelson Baker, interim dean of the College of Lifetime Learning. "The programs offered by the new College will not only focus on traditional degree paths but also on lifelong learning opportunities that cater to different stages of careers and lives, increasing competitiveness for employers across the state of Georgia."
