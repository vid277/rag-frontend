## Featured Lectures

The Woodruff School has four annual lectures series that give our community the opportunity to hear from distinguished speakers from academia, industry, government, and beyond.

### Gegenheimer Trailblazer Lecture

The Gegenheimer Lecture Series on Innovation was established in 1995 through an endowment from Mr. Harold W. Gegenheimer (Class of 1933) to support student programs that encourage creativity, innovation, and design. Through the lecture series and support of capstone design projects, students are exposed to processes that stimulate creativity and lead to inventions and patents. In 2019 The Gegenheimer Lecture Series was rebranded as the Gegenheimer Trailblazer Lecture Series, bringing in speakers who have exemplify leadership and innovation in their fields.
