**Policy Statements**:

01. Faculty-Led Study Abroad Programs (FLSA): Institute faculty and/or staff developing, proposing, and operating FLSA programs must seek approval and follow the guidelines set forth by the Institute, the Institute’s Study Abroad Committee (sub-committee of the IUCC/IGCC) and by the Office of International Education (OIE). \[See [Guidelines for FLSA programs](https://ea.oie.gatech.edu/content/faculty-led-study-abroad-current-prospective-program-director-resources).\]
02. Embedded Faculty-Led Study Abroad (FLSA): Embedded FLSA programs follow the same guidelines as specified in item #1: Embedded programs differ from other Faculty-led study abroad programs in that they are primarily Atlanta-based courses that include an international travel component, typically completed during an official break. \[See [Guidelines for FLSA Programs](https://ea.oie.gatech.edu/content/faculty-led-study-abroad-current-prospective-program-director-resources).\]
03. Global at Home Programs (G@H): G@H programs follow similar proposal guidelines as FLSA in item #1. These programs must be offered in a group format and must have a clear focus on global engagement and global competencies built into the programs’ learning outcomes. G@H programs may be offered either virtually, on the Atlanta campus, or may choose to include domestic field trips to complement in-class instruction. All travel must be course related with an academic focus, included for instructional purposes, and clearly tied to global learning outcomes. \[See [Guidelines for FLSA Programs](https://ea.oie.gatech.edu/content/faculty-led-study-abroad-current-prospective-program-director-resources).\]
04. Faculty leading programs: Teaching and leading a program abroad is considered a position of responsibility and thus must follow Institute policies outlined for such positions.
05. GT Exchange Programs: Bilateral and direct enroll student exchange programs are vetted and approved through VPII/OIE in collaboration with GT Legal Affairs and must be officially signed by VPII.  Exchange programs are administered by OIE. \[See [Linkage Agreements](https://reports.oie.gatech.edu/Linkage_Agreements).\] \[See Exchange Administrative Policies.\]
06. Global Research and Internship Program (GRIP): GT students should register global research or international internship assignments via OIE. Once registered, students receive pre-departure briefing information and are automatically enrolled in the USG-approved international insurance plan covering official dates of the international assignment. Enrollment in the insurance plan is mandatory for all students. \[See the [GRIP Registration](https://grip.oie.gatech.edu/).\]
07. Student International Travel Registry: Students who plan to travel internationally for Institute affiliated purposes (that are not official Study Abroad, GRIP, or GT Exchanges) must register their travel through OIE. Some examples include international travel for dual/double/joint degree program requirements, research abroad, service abroad, international conferences, international academic competitions, international senior design, and international athletic competitions. The International Travel Registry provides the Institute with critical information and contacts in case of emergency. Once registered, students receive pre-departure briefing information and are automatically enrolled in the USG-approved international insurance plan covering official dates of the Institute affiliated international travel. Enrollment in the insurance plan is mandatory, and students benefit from the Institute’s discounted rates for coverage. Insurance is billed directly to students through the GT Bursar account. \[See [GT Student International Academic Project Travel Registry](https://atlas.gatech.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=0&Link_ID=B016F9CA-5056-BA1F-7230494E75F22ADA).\]
08. Non-GT Programs: Students participating on programs through providers or other institutions not affiliated with the Institute should register their participation with OIE. \[See [Non-GT Program Registry](https://atlas.gatech.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=0&Link_ID=D055F714-5056-BA1F-747057EF8EB9775A).\]
09. Restricted Travel Appeal Committee: GT monitors the guidance and advice of experts on international travel from the US Department of State ( [www.travel.state.gov](http://www.travel.state.gov/)). Students are not permitted to participate in Institute-affiliated travel to international locations with a level 3 or 4 alert from the US Department of State. \[See the [GT Policy on Restricted Travel](https://ea.oie.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/2024-04/GT%20Policy%20on%20Restricted%20Student%20Travel%20Abroad%20%28travel%20advisories%29%20-%2004.24.pdf).\]
10. GT aligns international program policies with the guidelines set forth by the University System of Georgia (USG). \[See the [USG Business Procedures Manual section 21.0](https://www.usg.edu/business_procedures_manual/section21/).\]

OIE is a unit of the [Vice Provost of International Initiatives](https://global.gatech.edu/) in the [Office of the Provost](https://provost.gatech.edu/).
