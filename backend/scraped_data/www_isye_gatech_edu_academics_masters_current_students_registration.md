### Registration

Can I audit an ISYE course?

No, we do not allow students to audit ISYE courses. Seats in ISYE courses must be reserved for students who are using the courses to satisfy degree requirements.

Can I take an ISYE course pass/fail?

Generally, no. All courses used to satisfy MS degree requirements must be taken on a letter-grade basis. If you are taking an ISYE course in excess of the degree (i.e. not counting towards any requirements), then you may request to change the grade mode to pass/fail AFTER Phase II registration has ended. This must be done before the Change of Grade Mode deadline published on the Registrar's Academic Calendar. Please contact the Academic Office or your program advisor if you have questions about this process.

How do I obtain a permit for a non-ISyE course?

ISyE personnel cannot grant permits for non-ISyE courses; each Georgia Tech School controls permits and waitlists for its courses.  Please see the Departmental Contact list from the Registrar's Registration website: [https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/permits-and-overloads](https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/permits-and-overloads "(opens in a new window)").

How do I obtain a permit to register for Special Problems?

See the ISyE Graduate Student Handbook for the process regarding Special Problems and Research Courses. [https://www.isye.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/graduate/graduate-handbook.pdf](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/graduate/graduate-handbook.pdf)

Note: Registration for ISyE 8900 and 8901 is by permit only. **Students must submit a request form no later than Wednesday of the final week of course registration**. [https://forms.isye.gatech.edu/](https://forms.isye.gatech.edu/ "(opens in a new window)")

Permit requests are approved first by the faculty advisor/instructor, and second by our Associate Chair. Once the request is approved by both parties, a permit will be issued.

Letter-graded course requests are limited to 3 credit-hours, and must include a course syllabus and a document describing the course grading procedure.

How does Cross-Registration work?

The application for students interested in cross-registration can be found here: [https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/cross-registration](https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/cross-registration "(opens in a new window)").  Graduate students should obtain prior approval from their faculty program advisor to ensure the cross-registration course will count toward their degree.

Please note there is a separate cover sheet required for Emory cross-registration ( [https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/emory-cross-registration-cover-sheet](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/emory-cross-registration-cover-sheet "(opens in a new window)")).

I am trying to register, but keep seeing a Major Restriction error. How do I get a permit?

We do not grant permits to non-ISyE MS majors.  Major restrictions will lift the last Wednesday of Phase II registration.  If a course is full, please add to the waitlist.  [https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/waitlists](https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/waitlists "(opens in a new window)")

Moreover, students should review OSCAR's Schedule of Classes for any course restrictions/comments. [https://oscar.gatech.edu/](https://oscar.gatech.edu/ "(opens in a new window)")

What is your policy on overloads?

We do not overload.  If a course is full, please add to the waitlist. Degree candidates and Senior PhD students are given priority on the waitlist. [https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/waitlists](https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/waitlists "(opens in a new window)")

## Waitlisting

- if a course is full (closed), but has the waitlist enabled, join it
- [Instructions for Waitlisting](https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/waitlists "(opens in a new window)")

## Permits and Overloads for ISyE Courses

- ISyE cannot grant permits for non-ISyE courses; each school controls its courses.  Refer to the [Registration Departmental Contact List](https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/permits-and-overloads "(opens in a new window)").

- ISyE does **not grant overloads** nor do we enforce prerequisites for graduate students

## Holds

- Many departments have the ability to place registration and/or transcript holds on student accounts. The department who placed the hold must remove the hold (i.e. ISyE cannot remove a Grad Admiss hold)

## Error Messages

- If you receive an Error Message when attempting to register for a course, please refer to the [Registrar's error message webpage](https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/error-messages "(opens in a new window)") for an explanation of what the error means
