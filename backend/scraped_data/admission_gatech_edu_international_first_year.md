## International First-Year Admission

With over 1,000 undergraduate international students, Georgia Tech is home to a thriving, globally diverse population. We are excited to welcome applicants from all over the world!

### International Student Application Process

In our admission process, we closely review your specific academic background and particular educational system in order to make the most appropriate admission decision for each student. Applications are read within the context from which you are applying. For example, if you are from Panama but living in Illinois, your application will be read with those from Illinois. Likewise, if you are from Illinois but living in France, your application will be read with those from France. If you have been enrolled in high schools in more than one location, your application will be reviewed in context of each location.

**International first-year applicants go through the same [application process](https://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/application-review) as all other students, regardless of residency. However, transcript requirements may vary (see below).**

### English Language Proficiency

**The University System of Georgia requires that all international applicants demonstrate English proficiency using one of the [USG approved methods](https://www.usg.edu/international_education/esl_programs/english_proficiency_requirements).**

Beyond satisfying this requirement, we consider your English language mastery and communication skills in a variety of ways to ensure you are immediately prepared to participate in Georgia Tech’s collaborative environment. As part of a selective review process, in addition to considering your school context, we welcome supplementary materials such as the [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/applicants) and encourage an unscripted interview through [InitialView](https://initialview.com/) or [Vericant](https://www.vericant.com/for-students/) to further support your application. These materials do not satisfy [USG requirement](https://www.usg.edu/international_education/esl_programs/english_proficiency_requirements) noted above but are considered in holistic review.

### International Transcript Requirements

Every year, we receive applications and academic records from a variety of international and local, national curricula, so don’t worry! We recognize that many educational systems around the world do not fit the same GPA construct, calendar system, or four-year US high school model. We require academic records from each year of your secondary school experience to evaluate your application for admission. If your high school curriculum is fewer than four years of study, you will need to submit a fourth year of transcripts in order to enrolll, though this can be submitted after admission prior to enrollment.

_\*If your high school curriculum is fewer than four years of study, you will need to submit a fourth year of transcripts in order to enroll. For instance, if you complete high school in China where high school consists of 10, 11, and 12 grades, you will also need to submit a copy of 9 grade transcripts before enrolling._

## Post-Secondary Qualifications

Students are only eligible to apply for first-year admission if they have NOT completed university coursework following high school graduation. If you have completed any university\* coursework following the completion of senior secondary school, you will need to apply as a [transfer student](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer). This does not include students studying advanced coursework in a secondary setting (such as an A-Level curriculum).

_\*Note that this does include students enrolled in a Malaysian ADTP._
