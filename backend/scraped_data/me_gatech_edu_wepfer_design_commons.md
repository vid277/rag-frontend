## Wepfer Design Commons

![Design dedication](https://me.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/inline-images/DesignDedication.jpg)

On Friday, January 17, 2020, alumni, donors, faculty, staff, and students gathered outside of the Flowers Invention Studio to honor Dr. Bill Wepfer for his years of service and celebrate the completion of the Wepfer Design Commons. Construction of the Wepfer Design Commons, which includes the Montgomery Machining Mall, Flowers Invention Studio, IDEA Lab, and Electronics Lab, began during Dr. Wepfer's tenure as Chair of the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering and was completed in 2019.

The Wepfer Design Commons is part of the Woodruff School's commitment to providing students with unparalleled resources to design, test, and build almost anything they can conceive.

## Flowers Invention Studio

The Flowers Invention Studio evolved into a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art makerspace over the Summer of 2018. The new space was designed by HLG Studios with direct input from the Prototyping Instructors. This space and equipment is entirely **student run** and supports ALL students, staff, and faculty in building their dream project, whether it’s for research, personal or academic usage.
