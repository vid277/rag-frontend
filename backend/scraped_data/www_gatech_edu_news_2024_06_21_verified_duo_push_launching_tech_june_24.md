# Verified Duo Push Launching at Tech June 24

Jun 21, 2024


The Office of Information Technology (OIT) is taking steps to reinforce Georgia Tech’s defenses against cyberattacks such as [Duo two-factor authentication push scams](https://news.gatech.edu/news/2024/05/16/alert-duo-authentication-scam). These measures include the strengthening of security of logins to Institute systems by implementing [Verified Duo Push](https://gatech.service-now.com/home?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0043706) by the end of business day, Monday, June 24.

Verified Duo Push is a more secure version of Duo Push, the current two-factor authentication system used by Georgia Tech that adds a layer of security to campus online accounts. Verified Duo Push provides additional security against “push harassment” and “push fatigue” by requiring users to enter a three-digit code, rather than “approve” or “deny” options, to verify an authentication request. (Codes expire after 60 seconds.) Verified Duo Push also provides improved fraud reporting by directing users to a fraud-report option in the Duo Mobile application when they receive unexpected Duo Push login requests.

Verified Duo Push requires Duo Mobile 4.16.0, or later, on Android devices (Android 8 or later; 2017 or newer) or Duo Mobile 4.17.0, or later, on Apple devices (iOS 13 or later; iPhone 6s, 2015 or newer). You can learn more about Verified Duo Push and its requirements for use in the Georgia Tech knowledge article, “ [How to Use the Verified Duo Push Authentication Method (KB0043706](https://gatech.service-now.com/home?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0043706) [)](https://gatech.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0043706).”

While disruptions during the implementation period are not expected, if you experience issues or have questions, please submit a help request by visiting [services.gatech.edu.](https://services.gatech.edu/)
